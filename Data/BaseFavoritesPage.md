I like to describe myself as the kind of person who has a list of his favorite physicists and a list of his favorite mathematicians. The thought behind this description is that just knowing I have these types of lists tells you everything you really need to know about me. I try to keep these lists up-to-date based on my current feelings. Please remember that these are my personal favorites, not those whom I think are the "best", whatever that means, or even most influential. Please feel free to comment on this list using Twitter {TwitterLink}.

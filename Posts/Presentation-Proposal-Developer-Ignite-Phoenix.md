I just submitted the following proposal for a talk at [Developer Ignite Phoenix](https://web.archive.org/web/20090718201343/http://software.intel.com:80/en-us/articles/developer-ignite/) which will be held July 22, 2009 at Gangplank in Chandler.


> ## Simplicity Through Abstraction
> 
> The goal of this presentation is to explore, at a very high level, one methodology for software developers and architects to create software that is simple and maintainable, and thus has a lower total-cost-of-ownership (TCO).
> 
> Using abstraction via the provider pattern allows us to create software that is more testable, easier to map (find the piece of code that does X), and easier to understand at a component level. We can use providers to develop systems that have fewer bugs, and are more maintainable then tightly-coupled systems. As a result, these abstractions can significantly reduce costs for most systems, especially in the area of system maintenance.


I look forward to seeing you there.

I will be speaking at the [Developer Ignite](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/developer-ignite/) event in Chandler on July 22nd.  The topic of my talk will be "Simplicity Through Abstraction" during which I will be giving a very high-level overview of using Dependency Injection as an Inversion-of-Control methodology to create simplicity in software architecture.

While putting my presentation together I have found a number of items that I wanted to include in my presentation, but simply can't due to the obvious constraints of a 5-minute presentation.  Some of these items won't even get a mention, others will be mentioned only in passing.  I include them here as a list of topics for me to discuss in future posts to this blog.  Hopefully this will occur, at least in part, prior to the ignite event so that there will be a set of resources available to those at the event who were previously unfamiliar with these techniques and wish to explore them further.

These topics include:

- IoC Containers
- Dealing with Provider-Specific requirements
- Configuration as a dependency
- Local providers for external dependencies
- Providers as application tiers
- Testing at the provider level
- Top Down Design [Added: 7/12/2009]


If you have a topic that you are particularly interested in, or have any questions about IoC, Dependency Injection, or Providers that you would like me to answer, please use the comments or contact me via twitter: [@bsstahl](http://twitter.com/bsstahl).

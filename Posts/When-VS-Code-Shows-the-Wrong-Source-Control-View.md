Recently, I encountered a confusing issue with Visual Studio Code where the source control tab wasn't showing my modified files anymore. Git was correctly detecting changes since the `git status` command correctly showed modifications, but those changes weren't appearing in VS Code's source control panel. Instead, I was seeing a graph view of my repository history.

## The Investigation

I turned to Claude Sonnet 3.7 (via the Cline extension in VS Code) for help troubleshooting this issue. We started with some basic diagnostics:

1. First, we verified Git was working correctly by viewing modified fiels in the terminal using **git status**
2. We checked VS Code's Git extensions and settings to see if anything was misconfigured
3. Claude suggested trying the Ctrl+Shift+G keyboard shortcut, which immediately showed the correct view with my modified files

This last step was the key insight - pressing Ctrl+Shift+G showed the standard Source Control view with a list of modified files (what I wanted), but clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar showed a different view (the graph view).

## The Solution

After some investigation, we discovered the root cause: I had two different source control icons in my Activity Bar:

1. One at the top labeled "Source Control" that showed the graph view
2. One at the bottom (off-screen, requiring scrolling) labeled "Source Control (Ctrl-Shift-G)" that showed the view of changed files

The solution was simple:

* Remove the unwanted icon (the top one showing the graph view)
* Move the correct icon ("Source Control (Ctrl-Shift-G)") to a more visible position in the Activity Bar

After making these changes, clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar now consistently shows my modified files, just like pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.

## Why This Happens

VS Code allows multiple views with similar icons to coexist in the Activity Bar. This flexibility is powerful but can sometimes lead to confusion:

* Extensions can add their own source control-related views
* These views might use similar terminology and iconography
* Without careful attention to the hover labels, it's easy to confuse which icon does what

In my case, I had somehow ended up with duplicate Source Control icons in my Activity Bar, each showing different views of my repository.

## Preventing Future Issues

To avoid similar confusion in the future, I will make sure that I:

* Hover over icons in the Activity Bar to see their full labels
* Pay attention to keyboard shortcuts listed in the labels (like "Ctrl-Shift-G")
* Right-click on the Activity Bar and review which views are enabled
* Remove the ones I use less frequently when I end up with multiple, similar icons.

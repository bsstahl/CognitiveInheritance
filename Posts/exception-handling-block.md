Rob Bagby continued his outstanding presentations with not just an overview of the Exception Handling Block, but a full-blown strategy for handling exceptions. Rob had 5 goals for the session which I have paraphrased below:

1. Understand when and why to catch an exception To Recover from the error (or attempt to) To Add Context To Clean up (close connections, etc) To Log or Notify To hide the details of an exception
2. Understand the categories of exceptions Business Technical Security
3. Understand what is truly an exception Don't use exceptions for flow-control
4. Understand Exception Propogation Options Automatic Propogation (bubbling) Catch & Rethrow Clean Resolve LogCatch, Wrap & Throw Wrapped
5. Understand Custom Exceptions and When to Use Them
when an appropriate exception doesn't already exist To add discreet handling To add a specific behavior or information 

Rob went into quite a few specifics on exactly how this information could be utilized which is in the slide decks that I will link to asap.

This session got my vote as the most useful session of the day. Thanks Rob!

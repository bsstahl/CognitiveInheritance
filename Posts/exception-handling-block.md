title: Exception Handling Block
description: ''
content: "Rob Bagby continued his outstanding presentations with not just an overview
  of the Exception Handling Block, but a full-blown strategy for handling exceptions.
  Rob had 5 goals for the session which I have paraphrased below:\n\n1. Understand
  when and why to catch an exception \n\t1. To Recover from the error (or attempt
  to)\n\t1. To Add Context\n\t1. To Clean up (close connections, etc)\n\t1. To Log
  or Notify\n\t1. To hide the details of an exception\n1. Understand the categories
  of exceptions\n\t1. Business\n\t1. Technical\n\t1. Security\n1. Understand what
  is truly an exception \n\t1. Don't use exceptions for flow-control\n1. Understand
  Exception Propogation Options \n\t1. Automatic Propogation (bubbling)\n\t1. Catch
  & Rethrow \n\t\t1. Clean\n\t\t1. Resolve\n\t\t1. Log\n\t1. Catch, Wrap & Throw Wrapped\n1.
  Understand Custom Exceptions and When to Use Them\n\t1. When an appropriate exception
  doesn't already exist\n\t1. To add discreet handling\n\t1. To add a specific behavior
  or information \n\nRob went into quite a few specifics on exactly how this information
  could be utilized which is in the slide decks that I will link to asap.\nThis session
  got my vote as the most useful session of the day. Thanks Rob!"

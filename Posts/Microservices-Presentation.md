The slide deck for my presentation “Examples of Microservice Architectures” can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AswbHpz53UVdmb54V_pOCZHH6haGrg).


> There isn't one clear answer to the question "what does a micro-service architecture look like?" so it can be very enlightening to see some existing implementations. In this presentation, we will look at 2 different applications that would not traditionally be thought of as candidates for a service-oriented approach. We'll look at how they were implemented and what benefits the micro-services architecture brought to the table for each application.

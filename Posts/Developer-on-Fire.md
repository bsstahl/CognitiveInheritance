I was recently interviewed by Dave Rael ([@raelyard](https://twitter.com/raelyard)) for his [Developer on Fire Podcast](https://t.co/jhLI82mfia).Â  I had a great time talking with Dave about a lot of different things, both professional and personal, and got to name-drop just a few of the many people who have been a part of my journey over the years.

I also took the opportunity to talk about a few things that have been on my mind:

- The upcoming [AZGiveCamp](http://meetup.com/azigivecamp) Event scheduled for March 2019
- Some of [the giants on whose shoulders we stand](https://twitter.com/bsstahl/status/878043411923599360)
- A few of the technologies that are making me happy right now:
    - [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [Blazor](https://blazor.net/)
    - [AI, Combinatorial Optimization and Genetic Algorithms](http://www.cognitiveinheritance.com/?tag=/ai)
- A couple of resources I learn from:
    - [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org)
    - The works of [David McRaney](http://davidmcraney.com/)


I hope you enjoy this interview and find something of value in it. If so, please let me know about it on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/bsstahl).

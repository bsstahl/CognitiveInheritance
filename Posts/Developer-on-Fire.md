I was recently interviewed by Dave Rael ([@raelyard](https://twitter.com/raelyard)) for his [Developer on Fire Podcast](https://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-399-barry-stahl-optimizing-impact).Â  I had a great time talking with Dave about a lot of different things, both professional and personal, and got to name-drop just a few of the many people who have been a part of my journey over the years.

I also took the opportunity to talk about a few things that have been on my mind:

* The upcoming [AZGiveCamp](https://www.meetup.com/azgivecamp) Event scheduled for March 2019
* Some of [the giants on whose shoulders we stand](https://twitter.com/bsstahl/status/878043411923599360)
* A few of the technologies that are making me happy right now:
  * [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
  * {SearchLink:ai|AI, Combinatorial Optimization and Genetic Algorithms}
* A couple of resources I learn from:
  * [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org)
  * The works of [David McRaney](http://davidmcraney.com/)

I hope you enjoy this interview and find something of value in it. If so, please let me know about it {TwitterLink}.

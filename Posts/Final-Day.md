**Day 3** | 5/29/2003 6:10 PM, EDT
 Highlights of the final sessions of TransITech 2003 include a number of case studies where advanced technologies, such as wireless networks and PDA devices, have been successfully employed in the transit industry. I want to thank all of the presenters and the hosts of this outstanding event for their efforts. Attendance at this conference was well worth the effort for me and I highly recommend it for anyone involved in Transit Industry IT. For those I met at this conference, I look forward to talking to you again soon, or at least seeing you at next year's conference in Houston. To those who I did not have opportunity to meet, please feel free to drop me a line.

It's AZGiveCamp time again! Our third event is coming up in under 2 weeks, Oct 21st-23rd 2011 at the Park Central Mall (Central Ave. between Thomas and Osborn) in midtown Phoenix. Please sign-up to volunteer as a developer, designer, or analyst on our [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/AZGiveCamp) or see [AZGiveCamp.org](https://www.azgivecamp.org) for more details.

Special appeal: we need graphic designers! If you’re a pro or amateur, it doesn’t matter. Designers are always the most popular people at any GiveCamp!

Those who participated in the last 2 events already know that AZGiveCamp is the local component of a national event where the software development community comes together to support local charities and non-profits by developing or improving their web sites and applications. It's fun, it's agile, it's geeky, and it's good for the community.

We had a fantastic time at the last 2 events and, in Arizona alone, have helped more than 20 non-profits with their development needs. As someone who has now participated in GiveCamps as both a participant and as an organizer, I can honestly say the experience is very, very, worthwhile.

You can find out more about AZGiveCamp at [https://www.azgivecamp.org](https://www.azgivecamp.org) and about the national organization at [https://givecamp.org](https://givecamp.org).

I am very excited about this event and look forward to working with all of you at AZGiveCamp III.

I'd like to announce that I have decided to accept an offer of employment with US Airways, designing and developing software for their Airline Operations Development (AirOps) group. This offer follows approximately 1.5 years of working for US Airways in AirOps as [CopperByte, Inc](http://www.copperbyte.com/).'s primary customer and my acceptance is testament to the fact that I have found it to be an outstanding place to work.  We have worked on some fairly exciting projects during my time with AirOps, often using the latest-and-greatest technology from Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and others.  I look forward to continuing this work.

It should be known that I will continue my relationship with [CopperByte, Inc.](http://www.copperbyte.com/) as an owner and director, and will occasionally participate as a developer and architect, primarily with regard to our not-for-profit endeavors such as with the [Pueblo Grande Museum](http://www.pgmarket.org/) and  [GIPhoneHome](http://www.giphonehome.com/).

I probably don't need to mention that the usual caveats apply here.  All opinions are mine and mine alone; US Airways has, and will continue to have, nothing to do with this blog. All information contained herein is entirely my responsibility.

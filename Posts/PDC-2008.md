Next week I will be attending the Microsoft Professional Developer's Conference in Los Angeles. This will be my 6th PDC (of, I believe, 10).Â  I will be attempting, as I have done in the past, to blog each session that I attend, as well as other events and functions at the PDC. I will also be updating my status on Twitter ([http://www.twitter.com/bsstahl](http://www.twitter.com/bsstahl)) on a regular basis.

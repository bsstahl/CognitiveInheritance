&quot;**The Critical C's of Microservices**&quot; are a series of conversations that development teams should have prior to building event-driven or other microservice based architectures. These topics will help teams determine which architectural patterns are best for them, and assist in building the systems and processes in a reliable and supportable way.

The &quot;Critical C's&quot; are: **Context**, **Consistency**, **Contract**, **Chaos**, **Competencies** and **Coalescence**. Each of these topics will be covered in detail in this series of articles. This is article 5 of the 6, and covers the topic of **Competencies**.

#### Competencies

#### Next Up - Coalescence

In the next article of this series we will look at **Coalescence** and how we should work to bring all of the data together for our operations & support engineers.

&quot;**The Critical C's of Microservices**&quot; are a series of conversations that development teams should have around building event-driven or other microservice based architectures. These topics will help teams determine which architectural patterns are best for them, and assist in building their systems and processes in a reliable and supportable way.

The &quot;Critical C's&quot; are: **Context**, **Consistency**, **Contract**, **Chaos**, **Competencies** and **Coalescence**. Each of these topics will be covered in detail in this series of articles. The first article of the 6 was on the subject of {PostLink:critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context|Context}. This is article 5 of the series, and covers the topic of **Competencies**.

#### Competencies

#### Goals of the Conversation

Development teams should have conversations around **Competencies** that are primarily focused around [TODO]. These conversations should include answering questions like:

* [TODO: Add questions here]

#### Next Up - Coalescence

In the next article of this series we will look at **Coalescence** and how we should work to bring all of the data together for our operations & support engineers.

The slide deck for my talk “A Developer’s Survey of AI Techniques” can be found below, while the demo code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/bsstahl/AIDemos).


 


The talk explores some of the different techniques used to create Artificial Intelligences using the example of a Chutes & Ladders game.  Various AIs are developed using different strategies for playing a variant of the game, using different techniques for deciding where on the game board to move.

If you would like me to deliver this talk, or [any of my talks](http://www.cognitiveinheritance.com/page/Speaking-Engagements.aspx), at your User Group or Conference, please [contact me](http://www.cognitiveinheritance.com/contact.aspx).

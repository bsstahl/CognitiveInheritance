Joe Guadagno has posted [his summary of The Best of PDC in PHX](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://weblogs.asp.net/jguadagno/archive/2008/12/11/the-best-of-pdc-in-phx.aspx). This was a great event and I want to make sure those who put it together, spoke, and sponsored it know we are tremendously appreciative of their efforts.  This includes: [Joseph Guadagno](https://www.josephguadagno.net/), [Scott Cate](https://www.scottcate.com/) and [Rob Bagby](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/bags/) as well as [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Robert Half Technology](https://www.rht.com/), [TekSystems](https://www.teksystems.com/) and [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/).

I think that the best summary I can give of my experience at this event is through the tweets I sent in real-time while there.  Below, are what I think are my tweets most representative of the experience.

> At first I hated that C# didn't have optional params. Now I know that life is better w/o them. Sorry C# 4.0.

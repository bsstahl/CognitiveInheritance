title: Understanding the ID Entanglement Effect
description: Using composite IDs can lead to the "ID Entanglement Effect," causing structural dependency, data parsing issues, maintenance complexity, inflexibility, and data integrity risks to our applications. To avoid these pitfalls, it's recommended to use clear, atomic identifiers, which enhance scalability, maintainability, and data integrity.

In system design, creating unique identifiers often involves complex methods. One common approach is using composite IDs, where multiple elements form a single identifier. This method can lead to what we call the "**ID Entanglement Effect**" highlighting the complications that arise from such practices.

## Critical Characteristics

### Structural Dependency

Systems relying on a specific format for composite IDs become fragile. Any format change can disrupt functionality and complicate maintenance.

### Data Parsing

Extracting components from a composite ID is often inevitable, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors, especially if parsing logic is flawed.

### Maintenance Complexity

Parsing logic embedded throughout the codebase increases complexity, making debugging and future development challenging.

### Inflexibility

Composite IDs limit adaptability. Modifications can ripple through the system, complicating changes or scaling.


### Data Integrity Risks

Parsing composite IDs can lead to inconsistencies, especially in dynamic environments.

## The Way Forward

To avoid the ID Entanglement Effect, it's important to use clear, atomic identifiers:

* _Scalability_: Simple, unique identifiers make scaling and adaptation easier.
* _Maintainability_: Clear data structures reduce complexity, simplifying management.
* _Data Integrity_: Atomic identifiers reduce parsing errors and maintain consistency.

## Conclusion

While composite IDs may initially seem effective, they often lead to unintended issues. By understanding these pitfalls, developers can make better decisions, prioritizing clarity and simplicity. Embracing best practices enhances system robustness and supports sustainable growth and innovation.

I'm getting ready to head over to the Los Angeles Convention Center for the start of PDC 08. For those not here, you can watch the Ray Ozzie keynotes live on the web via [http://www.istartedsomething.com/20081026/pdc-08-keynote-live-streams/](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20081026/pdc-08-keynote-live-streams/) .Â  The Microsofties on Twitter are doing a great job of pumping-up the excitement for these keynotes with lots of comments on the media embargos and quips about how important this event is to Microsoft's future. I'll be publishing more information as it becomes available.

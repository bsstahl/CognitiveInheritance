Another great Desert Code Camp is in the books. A huge shout-out to all of the organizers, speakers & attendees for making the event so awesome.

I was privileged to be able to deliver two talks during this event:

* **A Developer’s Survey of AI Techniques**: Artificial Intelligence is far more than just machine learning. There are a variety of tools and techniques that systems use to make rational decisions on our behalf. In this survey designed specifically for software developers, we explore a variety of these methods using demo code written in c#. You will leave with an understanding of the breadth of AI methodologies as well as when and how they might be used. You will also have a library of sample code available for reference.
  * Code Samples: [https://github.com/bsstahl/AIDemos/tree/master/ChutesAndLaddersDemo/Simulation](https://github.com/bsstahl/AIDemos/tree/master/ChutesAndLaddersDemo/Simulation "https://github.com/bsstahl/AIDemos/tree/master/ChutesAndLaddersDemo/Simulation")
  * Slide Deck: (coming soon)

**AI that can Reason "Why"**: One of the big problems with Artificial Intelligences is that while they are often able to give us the best possible solution to a problem, they are rarely able to reason about why that solution is the best. For those times where it is important to understand the why as well as the what, Hybrid AI systems can be used to get the best of both worlds. In this introduction to Hybrid AI systems, we'll design and build one such system that can solve a complex problem for us, and still provide information about why each decision was made so we can evaluate those decisions and learn from our AI's insights.

As a seasoned technologist, I've navigated the landscape of software development, exploring various technologies and platforms. Today, I am thrilled to share that I have finally settled on a development platform that aligns perfectly with my preferred development tools - C# for code, and HTML5/CSS for UI. This platform, of course, is none other than Microsoft Blazor.

In the realm of web development, the execution context is constantly evolving, and the quest for better solutions is unending. As I discussed in my previous discourse on "Intro to WebAssembly Using Blazor", Blazor leverages the power of WebAssembly, a W3C specification that is revolutionizing the web development sphere of capabilities. It enables .NET developers to write web applications using C#, a language that many of us technologists are comfortable with.

In the past, I've expressed my affinity for using C# for code and HTML5/CSS for UI, as shared in the post "Are you Ready for the Next Episode?". This preference was born out of my experience with hybrid app development, where I found that the combination of HTML5 and C# provided a comfortable and efficient development environment. However, the need to embrace JavaScript for web applications was a challenge, as I was not as comfortable writing code in JavaScript.

Enter Blazor. This platform allows technologists like us to continue using the tools we prefer. With Blazor, we can write our client-side code in C#, eliminating the need to switch to JavaScript. Moreover, Blazor's UI components can be defined using Razor syntax, which is a mix of HTML and C#. This aligns perfectly with my preference for using HTML5/CSS for UI.

In my discourse on "Windows 8 Store Development for Enterprise Devs", I discussed the power of Windows Runtime Components and how they can be written in C# and called from any Windows 8 Store code. With Blazor, this concept is taken a step further. Not only can we write our code in C#, but we can also use it to directly interact with our UI components, creating a seamless development experience.

Reflecting on my speculation in "Microsoft Developers and HTML5", it's fascinating to see how Microsoft has indeed made HTML5/CSS3/ECMAScript a first-class citizen within the .NET stack. With Blazor, we can now create an HTML5 project in Visual Studio and publish it as a standard HTML website or a .NET executable file.

In conclusion, Blazor appears to be the platform that perfectly aligns with my preferences and comfort zone. It allows me to leverage the power of C# and HTML5/CSS, creating a seamless and efficient web development experience. I am excited to continue my journey with Blazor and look forward to sharing my experiences and insights along the way. Stay tuned!

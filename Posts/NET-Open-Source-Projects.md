I had the satisfaction today of doing something I hadn't done in quite a while; that is, to submit a patch to an open-source project and have it accepted and merged into the code-base.  It wasn't an earth-shattering bug or a fix to an application that will help save humanity, just a fairly easy fix to a bug in an asynchronous activity that occurs after posting a blog entry in [BlogEngine.net](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/).  The part that I had forgotten about open-source projects was just how satisfying it is to contribute to a project that will benefit the community.  That, in combination with the fact that [Jeff Atwood of CodingHorror.com](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000904.html) has created [a list of potentially worthy .NET open-source projects](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pKxDW35algYebfs8nssTjIQ) (he will be contributing some cash to one or more of them in the near future) has reminded me of how much everyone benefits from these projects.  I won't bore you with another discussion of why and how open-source projects help everyone, I just felt that I should post a link to Jeff's list of projects and encourage everyone to take a look at the list and see if there is any project there that grabs your attention.  If so, please consider contributing some of your time and skills to that project.

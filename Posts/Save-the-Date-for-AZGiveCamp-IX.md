March 8th – 10th 2019

Mark your calendars to block-out the weekend of March 8th 2019 for the next AZGiveCamp Hackathon-of-Help. More details will be coming very soon so keep an eye on [AZGiveCamp.org](http://azgivecamp.org/) and [Meetup](http://meetup.com/azgivecamp) for all the particulars as soon as they are available.  I’m looking forward to seeing you all at our 9th event, helping those who help our community.

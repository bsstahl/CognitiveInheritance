**Day 2 - Early Afternoon Session** | 5/28/2003 3:00 PM, EDT

Early this afternoon, the COO of the Port Authority of Allegheny County, spoke about the outstanding relationship between IT and Operations at the Port Authority. The Work Order System team was featured in that talk as a success story of how this relationship can foster an environment of innovation. I couldn't agree more and would like to offer my thanks to all of the other members of that team who made the Work Order System project such a pleasure to work on.

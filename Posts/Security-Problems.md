The one major letdown from this conference so far has been security. Security guards have been juvenile in their dealings with developers, and have been invisible when needed. They order people near session doors to do their jobs for them, and will not provide any support for doing that job. It is too bad that something non-technical such as security can make busy sessions virtually impossible to attend and understand. Don Boxâ€™s latest talk on Indigo was such a session for me and I will not be able to know for certain what I missed in that session until the conference DVDs are released.

As a follow-up to my posts [here]({PathToRoot}/Posts/The-Missing-e2809cCreate-Unit-Teste2809d-feature-in-Visual-Studio-2012.html) and [here]({PathToRoot}/Posts/Regain-Access-to-the-CreateUnitTests-Command-in-VS2012.html) on the missing “Create Unit Test” feature in VS2012, I point you to [this post](https://web.archive.org/web/20190426104920/https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/visual-studio-unit-test-generator-is-feature-complete-v1-release-candidate-lands-2/) from the Visual Studio ALM & TFS blog announcing the Release Candidate of their new Unit Test Generator for Visual Studio.  According to the post, this extension

> “…adds the “create unit test” feature back, with a focus on automating project creation, adding references and generating stubs, extensibility, and targeting of multiple test frameworks.”

I am installing the extension now and will comment on how well it works for my TDD workflow in a future post.

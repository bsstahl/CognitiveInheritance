The next two months are packed with tons of great technical events that I am really looking forward to.  Below are some of the events that I am involved with and will be attending between now and the end of November. I hope to run into you at these events.  If you see me, please don’t hesitate to say “hi”. I do love to talk tech.

#### [Desert Code Camp](https://oct2016.desertcodecamp.com/session/1329) – Phoenix AZ – October 8th 2016

Desert Code Camp makes its triumphant return from hiatus this weekend at Chandler-Gilbert Community College in the south-east valley.  I will be delivering my talk, “A Developer’s Guide to Finding Optimal Solutions” which is an introduction to combinatorial optimization designed specifically for software developers, at 9:45 am in room CHO-110.

#### [IT/DevConnections](https://tmt.knect365.com/it-dev-connections/) – Las Vegas NV– October 10th-13th 2016

One of my favorite large conferences of the year is IT/DevConnections in Las Vegas.  This year marks my 4th attendance at this event, the 2nd as a speaker. I will be delivering the talk, “Dynamic Optimization – One Algorithm All Programmers Should Know”, a programmer’s introduction to Dynamic Programming, at 2:15 pm on October 13th in Brislecone 2 at the Aria Resort.

#### [Atlanta Code Camp](https://atlantacodecamp.com/2016/Speakers/Barry-Stahl) – Atlanta GA – October 15th 2016

This year marks my 2nd attendance at the Atlanta Code Camp.  My 1st experience there, last year when I presented on Dynamic Programming, was a big part of the inspiration for drilling deeper into the topic of combinatorial optimization. As such, I return to Atlanta this year with my new talk on the subject, “A Developer’s Guide to Finding Optimal Solutions”.

#### [NWVDNUG](https://www.meetup.com/nwvdnug/) & [SEVDNUG](https://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/) – Phoenix AZ – Oct 26th and 27th

It is not yet confirmed as of this publication but I have a really great, internationally renown speaker lined-up for the Northwest Valley and Southeast Valley .NET User Groups this month.  Final arrangements are currently being made so keep an eye on meetup.com for each group for the details to be published as soon as they are finalized.

#### [SoCalCodeCamp](https://www.socalcodecamp.com/session.aspx?sid=24d59c6a-d04a-4cf5-be16-52cd870a2013) – Los Angeles CA, November 12th – 13th 2016

I have attended many instances of the Southern California Code camp, but this will only be my 2nd time at the Los Angeles incarnation of this event.  My 1st time there, last year, I was struck by the old-school beauty of the old school campus and facilities at USC when I presented my talk on Dynamic Programming.  This year, I will follow that up with my new, more general overview on the subject of finding optimal solutions.

#### [NWVDNUG](https://www.meetup.com/nwvdnug/) & [SEVDNUG](https://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/) – Phoenix AZ – Nov 16th and 17th

Our good friend Jeremy Clark ([blog](https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremybytes)) makes his annual tour of the Valley’s .NET User Groups to talk to us, once again, about many of the things you need to know about .NET and Software Engineering to make your development better. Jeremy will give a different talk each night so be sure to sign-up at the meetup sites and come to both meetings.

As engineers, we often deal with increasing levels of abstraction and complexity in decision-making. Recent machine learning advances, especially semantic models, have increased this complexity, causing misunderstandings. Specifically, the ability of these models to generate ideas not directly in their training data, and whether these require human-like understanding. Let's look into Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and their ability to produce new ideas without human-like comprehension.

## The High-Dimensional Embedding Space

LLMs operate in complex high-dimensional vector spaces—often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions—that are beyond human cognitive capabilities to visualize. In these embedding spaces, each word, phrase, or concept is represented as a vector whose position encodes semantic meaning. The proximity between vectors (measured by cosine similarity or Euclidean distance) indicates semantic relatedness.

Unlike human understanding, which is built on conscious experience and intentionality, LLMs create meaning through statistical relationships in this high-dimensional space. They don't "understand" concepts as we do, but can identify patterns and associations that humans might overlook due to the mathematical properties of these spaces.

## Cross-Domain Associations Through Vector Relationships

The power of embedding spaces lies in their ability to encode relationships across seemingly disparate domains. For instance, an LLM might detect that the vector relationship between 'quantum entanglement' from physics and 'instantaneous correlation' shares mathematical similarities with the relationship between 'distributed systems' and 'real-time communication' in computer science.

This vector arithmetic (similar to the classic example "king - man + woman = queen") allows LLMs to suggest novel connections: "If quantum entanglement enables instantaneous correlation regardless of distance, could this principle inspire new approaches to low-latency distributed systems?" This isn't mere word association but a mathematical operation in the embedding space that can reveal non-obvious relationships.

Similarly, the vector relationship between 'utilitarianism' (maximizing overall happiness) and 'consequentialism' might share structural similarities with the relationship between 'loss function optimization' and 'machine learning training'. This mathematical similarity could suggest new ethical frameworks for AI that balance multiple competing objectives, similar to how multi-objective optimization works in machine learning.

## Encoding Complex Semantic Concepts

Let's examine how LLMs encode complex concepts like idioms and sarcasm. Take the phrase "Well, look who's on time". In the embeddings space, this phrase is positioned closer to vectors representing "Actually Late" than "Actually Early", despite containing no explicit reference to lateness. This indicates that the sarcastic nature and implied meaning are encoded in the vector representation itself.

We can visualize this with a simplified 2D projection:

```
                    "Punctuality"
                          |
"Actually Early"          |
      •                   |
                          |
                          |
"Arrived on               |         "Well, look
  schedule"               |          who's on time"
      •------------------+------------------•
                          |
                          |
                          |         "Actually Late"
                          |               •
                          |
```

In this simplified representation, we see that "Well, look who's on time" is positioned in the semantic space closer to "Actually Late" than to other phrases about punctuality, capturing the implicit sarcasm.

## From Association to Innovation

This mathematical encoding of semantic relationships enables LLMs to perform what appears to be creative reasoning. When prompted to consider problems from multiple angles, the model traverses its embedding space, finding connections between concepts that might not be obvious to human experts who typically operate within domain-specific knowledge silos.

For example, when considering the challenge of secure communication, an LLM might mathematically relate concepts from:
* Quantum key distribution (physics)
* Zero-knowledge proofs (cryptography)
* Trust establishment protocols (network security)
* Biological immune systems (biology)

The resulting vector relationships might suggest a novel approach to security that combines elements from all these domains—not because the LLM "understands" security, but because the mathematical relationships between these concepts in the embedding space reveal structural similarities.

## Limitations and Human Oversight

While this vector-based association mechanism is powerful, it's crucial to remember that these insights depend entirely on the training data. If the data is biased, incomplete, or contains flawed correlations, the embedding space will reflect these issues, potentially leading to misleading associations.

Furthermore, the LLM has no mechanism to verify the practical validity of its associations—it can identify that two concepts have similar vector relationships without confirming whether this mathematical similarity translates to a meaningful real-world connection. This is why human experts remain essential to interpret and validate these associations within their domain context.

In conclusion, while LLMs don't "understand" like humans, they can produce new ideas by identifying patterns in high-dimensional embedding spaces that might escape human notice. The mathematical nature of these vector spaces allows for cross-domain connections that can spark innovation. However, they remain tools to support human decision-making, and their outputs require careful interpretation by domain experts who can translate mathematical similarities into meaningful insights.

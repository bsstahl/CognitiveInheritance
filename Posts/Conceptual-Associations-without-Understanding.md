As engineers, we often find ourselves navigating ever-increasing levels of abstraction and complexity when it comes to decision-making. Recent advances in machine learning, especially in the area of semantic models, have made this complexity more acute than ever, leading to a number of misunderstandings and misdirections. Specifically, the ability of these model to create ideas not directly represented in their training data, and whether or not such things require human-like understanding of the problem or solution. Let's explore the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, and their potential to generate novel insights, even without human-like comprehension.

LLMs operate in high-dimensional spaces, well beyond any human cognitive capabilities. Since they are just mathematical models, they don't "understand" concepts in the way we do, but they can identify associations between concepts that might be overlooked by human analysts. This is due to their ability to process and analyze data in these high-dimensional spaces.

Consider these potential scenarios: an LLM could analyze a vast corpus of text and identify subtle associations between disparate ideas that might lead to a novel perspective or solution. For instance, it might associate the concept of 'quantum entanglement' from physics with 'real-time communication' in computer science, potentially sparking a new approach to data transfer technologies. Or, in the realm of philosophy and ethics, an LLM might draw parallels between 'utilitarianism' and 'machine learning optimization', leading to fresh ethical frameworks for AI development.

Let's delve deeper into how LLMs encode concepts, particularly complex ones like idioms and sarcasm. Take the sarcastic expression "Well, look who's on time". In the embeddings space, which is the high-dimensional space where words or phrases are mapped as vectors, this expression is closer to the phrase "Actually Late" than it is to "Actually Early". This indicates that the sarcastic nature of the original expression is "baked-in" to the encoded value of the expression.

This is a powerful demonstration of how LLMs can capture and encode the nuanced meanings of phrases based on their usage in the training data. It's not just about the literal words used, but the context in which they're used. This ability to encode sarcasm and idioms shows the potential of LLMs to understand and generate text that is rich in context and nuance, even if they don't "understand" the text in the way humans do.

These examples illustrate the power of LLMs to associate seemingly disparate ideas across domains, potentially leading to innovative insights and solutions. However, it's crucial to remember that these potential insights are still based on the indirect associations in the training data. While no human may have made the connection, the connection was there for the making inside the data. The LLM doesn't have an inherent understanding of the concepts involved. It's merely associating ideas based on the patterns it has learned. This means that the quality and representativeness of the training data are of utmost importance. If the data is biased or incomplete, the insights generated by the LLM might be misleading or incorrect.

Moreover, while these LLMs can generate novel insights, interpreting and applying these insights still require human expertise. LLMs can identify associations, but it's up to human experts to interpret these associations in the context of their domain knowledge and decide how to apply them.

In conclusion, even though LLMs don't "understand" in the human sense, they have the potential to produce novel insights and solutions by identifying associations in high-dimensional data. However, it's important to remember that these systems are tools to aid human decision-making, not replace it. Their outputs need to be interpreted and applied by human experts, and their training data needs to be carefully curated to ensure it's representative and unbiased.

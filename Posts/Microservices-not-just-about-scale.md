**Scalability** is an important feature of microservices and event-driven architectures, however it is only one of the many benefits these types of architectures provide. Event-driven designs create systems with high availability and fault tolerance, as well as improvements for the development teams such as flexibility in technology choices and the ability to subdivide tasks better. These features can help make systems more robust and reliable, and have a great impact on development team satisfaction. Therefore, it is important to consider these types of architectures not just for systems that need to scale to a high degree, but for any system where reliability or complexity are a concern.

TODO: Add details

While it is true that most systems won't ever need to scale to that point that they *require* a microservices architecture, most of these same systems do need the reliability and self-healing capabilities modern architectures provide. Additionally, everyone wants to work on a development team that is efficient and accomplishes their goals.

If you have avoided using event-driven microservices because scalability isn't one of the key features of your application, I encourage you to explore the many other benefits of these architectures.

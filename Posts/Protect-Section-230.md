> An open letter to Senators Kelly and Gallego urging them to oppose any weakening of the protections found in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996.

Dear Senator,

I am reaching out to express my strong opposition to any modifications or repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

I am a constituent and a professional with 40 years of experience in distributed systems development, including my work on some of the earliest Internet-based applications at Intel Corporation in Chandler.

Section 230 is a foundational element of the Internet's legal framework and altering it could have profound negative impacts on both free speech and competition in the Internet services space. Here are my primary concerns:

#### Impact on Free Speech

Section 230 provides a crucial liability shield that enables platforms to host diverse content without fear of constant litigation. Repealing or modifying this section would lead to increased censorship as platforms become overly cautious in moderating content. This could stifle free expression and create a chilling effect, where administrators are forced to censor, or shut down operations altogether, out of fear that perfectly legal speech might lead to liabilities for the platform. The open dialogue and exchange of ideas that are core to our democratic principles would be severely compromised.

In addition, modifying or even eliminating Section 230 wouldn't stop bad actors from spreading harmful content, as they are adept at exploiting loopholes and adapting to new platforms. A much better approach lies in addressing the behavior of the bad actors themselves, not transferring the responsibility onto Internet platform administrators. The issues that people seek to solve by modifying Section 230 simply would not be improved by this legislation. 

#### Impact on Competition

The current protections encourage innovation and allow new entrants to compete in the Internet services space. Without these protections, smaller companies and startups would face significant barriers to entry due to the threat of costly litigation and the need to support large staff of content moderators. This could lead to an even greater consolidation of power among a few large corporations, reducing competition and limiting consumer choice. Furthermore, these same increased operational costs could stifle innovation and slow the development of new technologies.

As someone who has been deeply involved in the growth and evolution of Internet technologies, I believe that maintaining the integrity of Section 230 is essential for fostering a vibrant, competitive, and open Internet. I urge you to consider the potential ramifications of modifying this critical piece of legislation and to oppose any efforts that would undermine its foundational principles.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I appreciate your service to our state and your consideration of my perspective. Please feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss this issue further.

Sincerely,

Barry Stahl

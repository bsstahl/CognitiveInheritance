After a long pause, I’m excited to share some great news: **the Valley of the Sun .NET user groups are officially restarting in 2026**! As one of the organizers — and one of the speakers for our first event — I couldn’t be more thrilled to help bring our community back together.

We’ll be hosting **quarterly meetups**, alternating between:

* **NWVDNUG** (Northwest Valley .NET User Group)
* **SEVDNUG** (Southeast Valley .NET User Group)

Each event will be **in-person at one location**, with a **livestream option** for the other group — so no matter where you are, you’ll have a way to participate.

### 🚀 First Event: Tuesday, January 20, 2026 at ASU West Valley

To kick things off, **Rob Richardson** and I will be presenting:

> **“.NET Aspire Accelerator: Fast-Track to Cloud-Native Development”**

This talk is a shortened version of the workshop Rob and I delivered in October 2025 in Porto, Portugal — tailored for our local community.

We’ll be live at the **Arizona State University (ASU) West Valley campus**, and the session will be streamed by the **.NET Foundation’s** [NET Virtual User Group](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-virtual-user-group/), making it accessible to developers **across the Valley and around the world**.

### 🔄 What’s Next?

The follow-up event will be in the **SE Valley around April**, continuing our quarterly rotation and hybrid format. We’re committed to making these meetups inclusive, energizing, and valuable for developers across the valley.

Meetup listings for January will be posted soon — on both the [NWVDNUG](https://www.meetup.com/nwvdnug/) and [SEVDNUG](https://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/) pages — so keep an eye out and RSVP when they go live.

Thanks for being part of this community. I can’t wait to see familiar faces and meet new ones as we reboot and reconnect in 2026.

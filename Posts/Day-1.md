**TransITech Day 1** | 5/27/2003 9:30pm EDT

Day 1 of APTA's TransITech Conference was an outstanding experience. I was very pleased that both the CEO and the CTO of the Port Authority of Allegheny County gave significant attention to the Work Order System application. The Chief Technology Officer in particular spoke of how 7 people in 18-months were able to put together, from scratch, a fully-integrated, web-based, top-of-the-line system. I am proud to have been even a small part of that effort.

I was happy to meet so many people from the other transit agencies around the US and Canada and look forward to meeting many more tomorrow. If you see me walking around the event hall, please feel free to introduce yourself. Just look for the CopperByte logo on my shirt.

I will be speaking tonight, 9/26/2018 at the [Northwest Valley .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/NWVDNUG/events/254835128/) and tomorrow, 9/27/2018 at the [Southeast Valley .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/events/254838096/). I will be speaking on the subject of WebAssembly. The talk will go into what WebAssembly programs look and act like, and how they run, then explore how we as .NET developers can write WebAssembly programs with Microsoftâ€™s experimental platform, Blazor.


> Want to run your .NET Standard code directly in the browser on the client-side without the need for transpilers or browser plug-ins? Well, now you can with WebAssembly and Blazor.
> 
> WebAssembly (WASM) is the W3C specification that will be used to provide the next generation of development tools for the web and beyond. Blazor is Microsoft's experiment that allows ASP.Net developers to create web pages that do much of the scripting work in C# using WASM.
> 
> Come join us as we explore the basics of WebAssembly and how WASM can be used to run existing C# code client side in the browser. You will walk away with an understanding of what WebAssembly and Blazor can do for you and how to immediately get started running your own .NET code in the browser.

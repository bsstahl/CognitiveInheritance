The demo code for my presentation on Testing in Visual Studio 2017 at the VS2017 Launch event can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/bsstahl/VS2017Launch).  There are 2 branches to this repository, the **Main** branch which holds the completed demo, and the **DemoStart** branch which holds the starting point of the demonstration in case you would like to implement the sample yourself.

The demo shows how Microsoft Fakes (formerly Moles) can be used to create tests against code that does not implement a reusable interface. This can be done  without having to resort to integration style tests or writing extra wrapper code just to implement an interface.  During my launch presentation, I also use this code to demonstrate the use of Intellitest (formerly Pex) to generate exploratory tests.

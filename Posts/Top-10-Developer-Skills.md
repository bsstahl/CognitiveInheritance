Justin James at TechRepublic posts his [top-10 list](https://web.archive.org/web/20090426193831/http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/10things/?p=643) of skills developers will need over the next 5 years.

His list:


> 1. One of the “Big Three” (.NET, Java, PHP)
> 2. Rich Internet Applications (RIAs)
> 3. Web development
> 4. Web services
> 5. Soft skills
> 6. One dynamic and/or functional programming language
> 7. Agile methodologies
> 8. Domain knowledge
> 9. Development “hygiene”
> 10. Mobile development




The areas where I have concerns are 5, 6, 9 & 10. What about you?

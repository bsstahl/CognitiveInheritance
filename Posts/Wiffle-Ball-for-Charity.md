On a personal note, I’ve signed-up to play in the Reggie Sanders Foundation’s Wiffle Ball tournament which is part of the MLB All Star Weekend.  The event is being held at [Salt River Fields at Talking Stick](https://saltriverfields.com/) on Saturday morning, July 9th at 9am.  On hand will be former MLB players and other celebrities and the event is to benefit the [Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center (SARRC)](https://www.autismcenter.org/).  If you are interested in playing, sponsoring, or attending, please contact John Zackery at (602) 421-3479 or by email at jzackery (at) gmail (dot) com.

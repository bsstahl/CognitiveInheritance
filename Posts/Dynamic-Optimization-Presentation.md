I hope you’ve had an opportunity to see my presentation, “Dynamic Optimization – One Technique all Programmers Should Know” at a Code Camp or User Group near you.  If so, and you want to have a copy of the slide deck for your very own, you can see it embedded below, or use the direct link to the Powerpoint [here](http://1drv.ms/1W5kd1J).

The subject of this presentation is using a technique called Dynamic Programming to solve problems that have more than one possible solution.  This technique works very well when used to solve problems that are recursive in nature.  One of the best things about this technique is that it guarantees that the solution it produces is the best possible solution.

We look at three examples during the presentation, the first is done only “on paper” and is an example of using this technique to solve a [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).  The second example is done in pseudo-code and solves a linear best-path problem in the game of Chutes & Ladders.  Finally, we drop into Visual Studio to solve a 2-dimensional best-path problem.  Sample code for both of the last 2 examples can be found in [GitHub](https://www.github.com/bsstahl/dpdemo).

Keep an eye on my [Speaking Engagements Page]({PathToRoot}/Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html) for opportunities to see this presentation live. If you are a user group or conference organizer, you can [contact me]({PathToRoot}/contact.html) to schedule an in-person presentation.  This presentation is a lot of fun to deliver and has been received extremely well at Code Camps and User Groups across the country.

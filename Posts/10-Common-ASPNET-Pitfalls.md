	Another MSDN back-article that I found interesting was in the [July 2006 issue](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/07/webappfollies/) where Jeff Prosise reviews what, from his experience, are 10 common ASP.NET gotchas.  Most of these items are fairly well understood, but I think we all have our specializations and can use any valuable tips/tricks we can find.  I, for example, rarely come in contact with User Controls.  I create Custom Controls when needed because I prefer the lifecycle and reuse benefits over those of User Controls.  So for me, the 1st tip that Jeff gives us about Output Caching User Controls could be very valuable the next time I am debugging an app created by others who have used User Controls.  My guess is that everyone will find out something new looking through this piece.

File this post under saving you some time that I spent worrying.

Recently, I started having problems with my OneNote notebooks not syncing on my primary laptop. Or at least, that’s what it seemed like was happening.  I depend a lot on OneNote since I use it for all of my notes, on all of my devices, so this was a very big deal for me. The notebooks all had the little red “not-synced” icon on them, so I would request a manual sync.  OneNote went through the process and looked like it was syncing, but at the end, all of the notebooks still had the little red icon on them saying they weren’t current.

The problem turned out to be that I had accidentally changed the radio-button at the top of the sync dialog from “Sync automatically whenever there are changes” to “Work offline - sync only when I click ‘Sync All’”.  As a result, the notebooks always looked as if they were not up-to-date (because they might not have been) and were listed as “Not connected”.  Of course, if I had looked at the last sync time, I would have seen that all notebooks had been synced as of the last manual sync.  Everything was working just fine, I had just changed the setting, making it so my notebooks only synced when I forced it.  By changing the radio button setting back to “Sync automatically…”, everything worked as I expected.

In this excellent session, Rob Bagby gave a warp-1 overview of much of the .NET Enterprise Library (Application Blocks). Some key points of the talk were:

- Config files for all blocks are now unified
- Crypto block provides Hashing & Encryption functionality
- Logging block provides a number of canned sinks including EventLog, DB, Text, MSMQ, Email and WMI
- A good resource on the Caching block is at [http://www.ronjacobs.com](http://www.ronjacobs.com/)


Of course, there were many other interesting items which I am unable to document here due to my mild case of brain disfunctionality, but again, I will post links to the slide-decks as I get them.

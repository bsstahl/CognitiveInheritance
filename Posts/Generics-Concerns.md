Another feature that concerns me (see my [earlier post](http://74.125.95.132/post.aspx?id=1b041dd9-2b92-4353-95be-f45c1ff2c408)) is .NET Generics. While it is nice to be able to specifiy a strongly-typed collection without having to create a class, it seems to me like this is still the [house of sticks](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa716279%28VS.60%29.aspx), rather than the house of bricks we really want. Also, extensibility seems to suffer in this model because we are limiting our encapsulation. I certainly have not used this enough to say one way or another for certain, I just currently have concerns.

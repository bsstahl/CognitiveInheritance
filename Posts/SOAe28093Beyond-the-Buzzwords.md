For those who saw my code camp presentation, “SOA – Beyond the Buzzwords”, you can find the slide deck [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=5D45DDF99C1E1BCC%21219769).

> There is much more to building a Service Oriented Architecture than just creating services. SOA services can be much more difficult to build, requiring more analysis and design work up-front than a non-service-enabled system or a system that relies on CRUD-style data services. In this session, we will look at real-world examples of SOAs, examining what a good SOA might look like, what conditions present a good opportunity to use a Service Oriented Architecture, and how we can make the process more agile. We will also look at some practical tips to help make your services more extensible and maintainable.

For those who haven’t yet seen this presentation, I will be giving this session at several other code camps and user groups around the US between now and the end of the year.  Keep an eye on my [Speaking Engagements page]({PathToRoot}/Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html) to know where and when I will be presenting.

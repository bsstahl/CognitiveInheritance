Upcoming Talks:

**Due to the Covid-19 crisis I will not be doing any in-person speaking for the remainder of 2020. Hopefully we will all be able to get to a new normal prior to the start of 2021.**

***

I have the following talks on topics of interest to Enterprise Developers that I can deliver at your user group or conference. You can submit a request for me to speak by [contacting me]({PathToRoot}/contact.html).

#### Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms

* **Amazing Algorithms for Solving Problems in Software** - Sure neural networks are cool but have you ever used a Firefly Algorithm to find the solution to a problem? How about an Ant Colony algorithm or one of  the many other algorithms inspired by nature?  In this talk we will see examples of a number of awesome bio-inspired algorithms that can be used to solve problems in software. We'll see how each one works, analyze its strengths and weaknesses, and determine when it is best used. You'll leave with the knowledge you need to solve problems using these algorithms in your language of choice.

* **Pushing AI to the Client with WebAssembly and Blazor** (also available as a half-day workshop) - Want to run your .NET Standard code directly in the browser on the client-side without the need for transpilers or browser plug-ins? Well, now you can with WebAssembly and Blazor. WebAssembly (WASM) is the W3C specification that will be used to provide the next generation of development tools for the web and beyond. Blazor is Microsoft's experiment that allows ASP.Net developers to create web pages that do much of the scripting work in C# using WASM. Come join us as we explore the basics of WebAssembly and how WASM can be used to run existing C# code client side in the browser. You will walk away with an understanding of what WebAssembly and Blazor can do for you and how to immediately get started running your own .NET code in the browser.

* **A Developer's Introduction to Artificial Intelligences** (also available as a half-day or full-day workshop) - There are a number of ways that developers can build systems that make decisions on our behalf. In this introductory course specifically for software developers, we explore a variety of methods used to create Artificial Intelligences. Using demo code written in c#, we will survey the breadth of AI methodologies and develop an understanding of when each might be best utilized. You will also leave with a library of sample code available for reference.

* **One AI Algorithm All Programmers Should Know** - This simple technique that every programmer should know can simplify certain types of problems tremendously, allowing us to find an optimal solution to difficult problems quickly and easily using a mathematical process called Dynamic Programming (not to be confused with Dynamic Languages or Functional Programming). In this session, we will run through examples of using this technique to solve several problems, both "on paper" and in code and apply that knowledge to build artificial intelligences that can make decisions on our behalf.

* **Building AI Solutions Using Combinatorial Solvers** - We depend on Artificial Intelligences to solve many types of problems for us. Some of these problems have more than one possible solution. Handling those problems with more than one solution while building a modern AI system is something every developer will be asked to do over the course of his or her career. Figuring out the best way to utilize the capacity of a device or machine, finding the shortest path between two points, or determining the best way to schedule people or events are all problems where mathematical optimization techniques and tooling can be used to quickly and efficiently find solutions. This session is a software developers introduction to using mathematical optimization in Artificial Intelligence. In it, we will explore some of the foundational techniques for solving these types of problems, and use combinatorial solver tools to put them to work in our AI systems. Since this is a session for developers, we'll keep it in terms that work best for us. That is, we'll go heavy on the code and lighter on the math. **Note**: This talk can be specifically targeted to one of several solver tools including
  Gurobi, Microsoft Solver Foundation and Google OR-Tools.

#### Development Patterns & Practices

* **Simplify Your API: Creating Maintainable and Discoverable Code in .NET Core** - Developers don't read documentation, this is a fact. It is also a fact that an API that  depends on its documentation to get developers to understand and discover its features is at a huge disadvantage in the marketplace. Fortunately, there are some simple, easy-to-use mechanisms for wrapping complex APIs and making their functionality both easy to use, and highly discoverable. Imagine being able to use tools like IntelliSense that the Visual Studio IDE already provides as a way to expose the functionality of your service or library. In this session we will build a fluent Domain Specific Language interface over an existing API to create an interface that is easy to use and discoverable through IntelliSense.

***

* **Design Patterns for Loosely Coupled Applications** - Building loosely coupled applications is critical to creating solutions that follow good object oriented development principles. These principles help make sure our applications are testable, maintainable and extensible. In this session we will explore several design patterns that are key to building applications that maintain loose coupling. We start by reviewing a tightly coupled application. Then, we explore several critical design patterns by using them to convert the application into a maintainable and extensible solution that can be validated using unit tests.

***

* **Test Driven Development in .NET Core** - In this talk, the speaker and the audience will "pair up" for a coding session which will serve as an introduction to using a Test Driven Development process to build a .NET Core application. We will use C#, Visual Studio, XUnit and MOQ to unit test code to be built both with and without dependencies. We will also highlight some of the common issues encountered during TDD and discuss strategies for overcoming them.

***

* Things Your Dev Team Hopes You Know - Managing a development team or project can be one of the most challenging jobs in any industry. Balancing the needs of the developers, the organization and the users to maximize value for the customers while minimizing costs can be a daunting prospect for even the most experienced executive.  How can we produce quality software in a timely and cost-effective manner when the needs of the development team are so different from the needs of the customers, the organization and its managers?

  > In this talk Barry leverages his more than 30 years of experience as a Developer and Solution Architect to remind us that how we leverage Agile ceremonies, how we use our tooling, and how we utilize metrics can have both positive and negative impacts on our teams.  He reviews many of the elements of our Agile processes and identifies their impacts, particularly on the developers and their managers. This talk challenges us to create environments for our development teams that enable them to exceed the expectations of both our users and our organizations.

***

#### Cloud Development

* **Building .NET Applications for any Cloud with Cloud Foundry** - Cloud Foundry is an open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS) available on virtually any cloud (Azure, IBM, Amazon, Google, and others) that manages containers and applications with many of the same capabilities of Docker and Kubernetes, without the complexity or vendor lock-in. In this session, we will build a .NET core based Microservices application and deploy it into production on Cloud Foundry to demonstrate the features and ease of use of the Cloud Foundry platform. Warning: once you experience Cloud Foundry you'll never want to deploy your applications without it again.

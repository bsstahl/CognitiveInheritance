<h4>Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms</h4>
<ul>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">Amazing Algorithms for Solving Problems in Software</span>
        - Sure neural networks are cool but have you ever used a Firefly Algorithm 
        to find the solution to a problem? How about an Ant Colony algorithm or one of 
        the many other algorithms inspired by nature?  In this talk we will see 
        examples of a number of awesome bio-inspired algorithms that can be used to 
        solve problems in software. We'll see how each one works, analyze its strengths 
        and weaknesses, and determine when it is best used.  You'll leave with the 
        knowledge you need to solve problems using these algorithms in your 
        language of choice.</li>

    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">Pushing AI to the Client with WebAssembly and Blazor (also available as a
            half-day workshop)</span> - Want to run your .NET Standard code directly in the browser on the
        client-side without the need for transpilers or browser plug-ins? Well, now you can with WebAssembly and
        Blazor. WebAssembly (WASM) is the W3C specification that will be used to provide the next generation of
        development tools for the web and beyond. Blazor is Microsoft's experiment that allows ASP.Net developers to
        create web pages that do much of the scripting work in C# using WASM. Come join us as we explore the basics
        of WebAssembly and how WASM can be used to run existing C# code client side in the browser. You will walk
        away with an understanding of what WebAssembly and Blazor can do for you and how to immediately get started
        running your own .NET code in the browser.</li>

    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">A Developer's Introduction to Artificial Intelligences (also available as a
            half-day or full-day workshop)</span> - There are a number of ways that developers can build systems
        that make decisions on our behalf. In this introductory course specifically for software developers, we
        explore a variety of methods used to create Artificial Intelligences. Using demo code written in c#, we will
        survey the breadth of AI methodologies and develop an understanding of when each might be best utilized. You
        will also leave with a library of sample code available for reference.</li>

    <p><HR/></p>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">One AI Algorithm All Programmers Should Know</span> - This simple technique
        that every programmer should know can simplify certain types of problems tremendously, allowing us to find
        an optimal solution to difficult problems quickly and easily using a mathematical process called Dynamic
        Programming (not to be confused with Dynamic Languages or Functional Programming). In this session, we will
        run through examples of using this technique to solve several problems, both "on paper" and in code and
        apply that knowledge to build artificial intelligences that can make decisions on our behalf. </li>
    <p><a href="https://OneAIAlgorithm.azurewebsites.net" target="slides">Latest Slide Deck</a></p>
    <p><HR/></p>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">Building AI Solutions Using Combinatorial Solvers</span> - We depend on
        Artificial Intelligences to solve many types of problems for us. Some of these problems have more than one
        possible solution. Handling those problems with more than one solution while building a modern AI system is
        something every developer will be asked to do over the course of his or her career. Figuring out the best
        way to utilize the capacity of a device or machine, finding the shortest path between two points, or
        determining the best way to schedule people or events are all problems where mathematical optimization
        techniques and tooling can be used to quickly and efficiently find solutions. This session is a software
        developers introduction to using mathematical optimization in Artificial Intelligence. In it, we will
        explore some of the foundational techniques for solving these types of problems, and use combinatorial
        solver tools to put them to work in our AI systems. Since this is a session for developers, we'll keep it in
        terms that work best for us. That is, we'll go heavy on the code and lighter on the math.
        <strong>Note</strong>: This talk can be specifically targeted to one of several solver tools including
        Gurobi, Microsoft Solver Foundation and Google OR-Tools.</li>

<!--
<li> <span style="font-weight: 900;" mce_style="font-weight: 900;">Building a Microservices Based Bot Framework Solution</span> - The Microsoft Bot Framework is a great way to create Natural Language user interfaces, such as applications that integrate with personal assistants like Siri and Alexa. Unfortunately, Bot Framework applications can easily result in a code monolith that can be difficult to modify, extend and scale, especially if multiple teams are involved in its creation. Using microservices as a replacement for the monolith can be a good solution to many of these problems. In this session, we will build a chatbot on the Microsoft Bot Framework that answers users questions formed in natural language by using separate microservices that allow each type of query to be created, modified, deployed and scaled independently. You&rsquo;ll leave with the ability to create your own chatbots that leverage the power of the Natural Language interface and the flexibility of microservices.</li>

<h4>Development Patterns &amp; Practices</h4>
<ul>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">Simplify Your API: Creating Maintainable and Discoverable Code in .NET
            Core</span> - Developers don't read documentation, this is a fact. It is also a fact that an API that
        depends on its documentation to get developers to understand and discover its features is at a huge
        disadvantage in the marketplace. Fortunately, there are some simple, easy-to-use mechanisms for wrapping
        complex APIs and making their functionality both easy to use, and highly discoverable. Imagine being able to
        use tools like IntelliSense that the Visual Studio IDE already provides as a way to expose the functionality
        of your service or library. In this session we will build a fluent Domain Specific Language interface over
        an existing API to create an interface that is easy to use and discoverable through IntelliSense. </li>

    <p><HR/></p>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">Design Patterns for Loosely Coupled Applications</span> - Building loosely
        coupled applications is critical to creating solutions that follow good object oriented development
        principles. These principles help make sure our applications are testable, maintainable and extensible. In
        this session we will explore several design patterns that are key to building applications that maintain
        loose coupling. We start by reviewing a tightly coupled application. Then, we explore several critical
        design patterns by using them to convert the application into a maintainable and extensible solution that
        can be validated using unit tests.</li>

    <p><HR/></p>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">Test Driven Development in .NET Core</span> - In this talk, the speaker and
        the audience will "pair up" for a coding session which will serve as an introduction to using a Test Driven
        Development process to build a .NET Core application. We will use C#, Visual Studio, XUnit and MOQ to unit
        test code to be built both with and without dependencies. We will also highlight some of the common issues
        encountered during TDD and discuss strategies for overcoming them.</li>

    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">Things Your Dev Team Hopes You Know</span>
        - Managing a development team or project can be one of the most challenging jobs in any industry. Balancing the
        needs of the developers, the organization and the users to maximize value for the customers while minimizing
        costs can be a daunting prospect for even the most experienced executive.  How can we produce quality software
        in a timely and cost-effective manner when the needs of the development team are so different from the needs of
        the customers, the organization and its managers? 
          
        In this talk Barry leverages his more than 30 years of experience as a Developer and Solution Architect to
        remind us that how we leverage Agile ceremonies, how we use our tooling, and how we utilize metrics can have
        both positive and negative impacts on our teams.  He reviews many of the elements of our Agile processes and
        identifies their impacts, particularly on the developers and their managers. This talk challenges us to create
        environments for our development teams that enable them to exceed the expectations of both our users and our
        organizations. </li>

<h4>Cloud Development</h4>
<ul>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: 900;">Building .NET Applications for any Cloud with Cloud Foundry</span> - Cloud
        Foundry is an open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS) available on virtually any cloud (Azure, IBM, Amazon,
        Google, and others) that manages containers and applications with many of the same capabilities of Docker
        and Kubernetes, without the complexity or vendor lock-in. In this session, we will build a .NET core based
        Microservices application and deploy it into production on Cloud Foundry to demonstrate the features and
        ease of use of the Cloud Foundry platform. Warning: once you experience Cloud Foundry you'll never want to
        deploy your applications without it again.</li>

I have the following talks on topics of interest to Enterprise Developers that         I can deliver at your user group or conference. You can submit a request for me to         speak by [contacting me](http://www.cognitiveinheritance.com/contact.aspx).



#### Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms

- Amazing Algorithms for Solving Problems in Software<br>        - Sure neural networks are cool but have you ever used a Firefly Algorithm <br>        to find the solution to a problem? How about an Ant Colony algorithm or one of <br>        the many other algorithms inspired by nature?  In this talk we will see <br>        examples of a number of awesome bio-inspired algorithms that can be used to <br>        solve problems in software. We'll see how each one works, analyze its strengths <br>        and weaknesses, and determine when it is best used.  You'll leave with the <br>        knowledge you need to solve problems using these algorithms in your <br>        language of choice.

- Pushing AI to the Client with WebAssembly and Blazor (also available as a<br>            half-day workshop) - Want to run your .NET Standard code directly in the browser on the<br>        client-side without the need for transpilers or browser plug-ins? Well, now you can with WebAssembly and<br>        Blazor. WebAssembly (WASM) is the W3C specification that will be used to provide the next generation of<br>        development tools for the web and beyond. Blazor is Microsoft's experiment that allows ASP.Net developers to<br>        create web pages that do much of the scripting work in C# using WASM. Come join us as we explore the basics<br>        of WebAssembly and how WASM can be used to run existing C# code client side in the browser. You will walk<br>        away with an understanding of what WebAssembly and Blazor can do for you and how to immediately get started<br>        running your own .NET code in the browser.

- A Developer's Introduction to Artificial Intelligences (also available as a<br>            half-day or full-day workshop) - There are a number of ways that developers can build systems<br>        that make decisions on our behalf. In this introductory course specifically for software developers, we<br>        explore a variety of methods used to create Artificial Intelligences. Using demo code written in c#, we will<br>        survey the breadth of AI methodologies and develop an understanding of when each might be best utilized. You<br>        will also leave with a library of sample code available for reference.

- One AI Algorithm All Programmers Should Know - This simple technique<br>        that every programmer should know can simplify certain types of problems tremendously, allowing us to find<br>        an optimal solution to difficult problems quickly and easily using a mathematical process called Dynamic<br>        Programming (not to be confused with Dynamic Languages or Functional Programming). In this session, we will<br>        run through examples of using this technique to solve several problems, both "on paper" and in code and<br>        apply that knowledge to build artificial intelligences that can make decisions on our behalf.

- Building AI Solutions Using Combinatorial Solvers - We depend on<br>        Artificial Intelligences to solve many types of problems for us. Some of these problems have more than one<br>        possible solution. Handling those problems with more than one solution while building a modern AI system is<br>        something every developer will be asked to do over the course of his or her career. Figuring out the best<br>        way to utilize the capacity of a device or machine, finding the shortest path between two points, or<br>        determining the best way to schedule people or events are all problems where mathematical optimization<br>        techniques and tooling can be used to quickly and efficiently find solutions. This session is a software<br>        developers introduction to using mathematical optimization in Artificial Intelligence. In it, we will<br>        explore some of the foundational techniques for solving these types of problems, and use combinatorial<br>        solver tools to put them to work in our AI systems. Since this is a session for developers, we'll keep it in<br>        terms that work best for us. That is, we'll go heavy on the code and lighter on the math.<br>        **Note**: This talk can be specifically targeted to one of several solver tools including<br>        Gurobi, Microsoft Solver Foundation and Google OR-Tools.

#### Development Patterns & Practices

- Simplify Your API: Creating Maintainable and Discoverable Code in .NET<br>            Core - Developers don't read documentation, this is a fact. It is also a fact that an API that<br>        depends on its documentation to get developers to understand and discover its features is at a huge<br>        disadvantage in the marketplace. Fortunately, there are some simple, easy-to-use mechanisms for wrapping<br>        complex APIs and making their functionality both easy to use, and highly discoverable. Imagine being able to<br>        use tools like IntelliSense that the Visual Studio IDE already provides as a way to expose the functionality<br>        of your service or library. In this session we will build a fluent Domain Specific Language interface over<br>        an existing API to create an interface that is easy to use and discoverable through IntelliSense.

- Design Patterns for Loosely Coupled Applications - Building loosely<br>        coupled applications is critical to creating solutions that follow good object oriented development<br>        principles. These principles help make sure our applications are testable, maintainable and extensible. In<br>        this session we will explore several design patterns that are key to building applications that maintain<br>        loose coupling. We start by reviewing a tightly coupled application. Then, we explore several critical<br>        design patterns by using them to convert the application into a maintainable and extensible solution that<br>        can be validated using unit tests.

- Test Driven Development in .NET Core - In this talk, the speaker and<br>        the audience will "pair up" for a coding session which will serve as an introduction to using a Test Driven<br>        Development process to build a .NET Core application. We will use C#, Visual Studio, XUnit and MOQ to unit<br>        test code to be built both with and without dependencies. We will also highlight some of the common issues<br>        encountered during TDD and discuss strategies for overcoming them.

- Things Your Dev Team Hopes You Know<br>        - Managing a development team or project can be one of the most challenging jobs in any industry. Balancing the<br>        needs of the developers, the organization and the users to maximize value for the customers while minimizing<br>        costs can be a daunting prospect for even the most experienced executive.  How can we produce quality software<br>        in a timely and cost-effective manner when the needs of the development team are so different from the needs of<br>        the customers, the organization and its managers? <br>          <br>        In this talk Barry leverages his more than 30 years of experience as a Developer and Solution Architect to<br>        remind us that how we leverage Agile ceremonies, how we use our tooling, and how we utilize metrics can have<br>        both positive and negative impacts on our teams.  He reviews many of the elements of our Agile processes and<br>        identifies their impacts, particularly on the developers and their managers. This talk challenges us to create<br>        environments for our development teams that enable them to exceed the expectations of both our users and our<br>        organizations.

#### Cloud Development

- Building .NET Applications for any Cloud with Cloud Foundry - Cloud<br>        Foundry is an open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS) available on virtually any cloud (Azure, IBM, Amazon,<br>        Google, and others) that manages containers and applications with many of the same capabilities of Docker<br>        and Kubernetes, without the complexity or vendor lock-in. In this session, we will build a .NET core based<br>        Microservices application and deploy it into production on Cloud Foundry to demonstrate the features and<br>        ease of use of the Cloud Foundry platform. Warning: once you experience Cloud Foundry you'll never want to<br>        deploy your applications without it again.

## Save the date for AZGiveCamp IX : March 8th-10th 2019



AZGiveCamp is a weekend event where software creators come together with some great local charities to build software that helps those charities further their mission.  Most of these groups do not have the resources to have an IT staff of their own so the software we create for them can truly make a difference in helping them achieve their goals for our community.  I am proud to have been one of the founders of AZGiveCamp, and to have spent the last decade leading its day-to-day activities.

If you'd like to find out more about AZGiveCamp, please see our [website](http://azgivecamp.org) or sign-up on our [Meetup page](http://meetup.com/azgivecamp).

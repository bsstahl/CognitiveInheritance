<h2 style="text-align: center;">Save the date for AZGiveCamp IX : March 8<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> 2019</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AZGiveCamp is a weekend event where software creators come together with some great local charities to build software that helps those charities further their mission.&nbsp; Most of these groups do not have the resources to have an IT staff of their own so the software we create for them can truly make a difference in helping them achieve their goals for our community.&nbsp; I am proud to have been one of the founders of AZGiveCamp, and to have spent the last decade leading its day-to-day activities.</p>

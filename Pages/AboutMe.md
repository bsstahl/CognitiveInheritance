I'm **Barry S. Stahl**, a Solution Architect and Developer working as the embedded architect in the Logistics organization at Carvana. I have been very fortunate in my journey to have worked with so many amazing people on such interesting and exciting projects.

### My Journey

My career kicked off with an incredible 11-year stint at Intel, where I had the unique opportunity to work on the International Space Station project – yes, really! It was an exhilarating experience that fueled my passion for innovative technology.

Following my time at Intel, I ventured into the airline industry. For another 11 years, I found myself at a single desk but working for three airlines due to mergers – America West, US Airways, and American Airlines. During this period, I focused on integrating Crew Systems, helping pilots and flight attendants by building applications that seamlessly connected data from various legacy systems.

In between these significant roles, I wore the hat of a consultant, working with different organizations across the country. One highlight was designing and building a Work Order system for bus and train maintenance for the Port Authority of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh, PA.

These diverse experiences eventually led me to Carvana, where I've spent a good portion of my time since 2019 designing and building a Logistics Transportation Management System.

### What I Do

My work primarily revolves around Microsoft technologies like C#, SQL Server, and Cosmos DB. However, I'm also adept with tools like Kafka and Redis when they fit the bill.

I specialize in designing and developing reliable integrated systems, especially using the Microservices pattern via Kafka or Azure Service Bus. My goal is to create systems that are self-healing to help protect our developers' nights and weekends from support calls.

Over the years, I've worked in the Optimization and AI space, utilizing Gurobi and Google's OR-Tools to solve interesting problems. More recently, I've been exploring the potential of Large Language Models like OpenAI in Azure, focused on using the amazing capabilities of those technologies while maintaining fair and transparent applications for my customers.

### Beyond Work

When I'm not immersed in technology, I'm a passionate baseball and hockey fan. Though I must admit, the NHL's decision to move the Coyotes out of Arizona has left me quite frustrated, especially since the Coyotes are right on the cusp of success.

I'm also deeply involved in community projects. As one of the founders of [AZGiveCamp](https://azgivecamp.org), I help organize weekend events where software creators collaborate with local charities to develop meaningful solutions that help those charities further their missions.

In my spare time, I maintain a list of [My Favorite Physicists & Mathematicians](https://cognitiveinheritance.com/Pages/Favorites.html) and shepard several [Open Source Projects](https://cognitiveinheritance.com/Pages/Open-Source.html). I'm a strong advocate for the open, independent social web, which is why you'll find me on platforms like Mastodon instead of Xitter.

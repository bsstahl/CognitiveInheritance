[ConFoo](Value Statement: ConFoo 2025 Speaking Engagement) is a premier multi-technology conference for developers, with a strong focus on enterprise development practices and emerging technologies. Held annually in Montreal, it attracts over 150 speakers from around the world and offers a large number of presentations. The conference is known for its high-quality technical content and its ability to bring together experts from various technology domains. I have presented at this conference twice before and have always found it to be a valuable experience.

#### My Presentations

For this conference, I'll be giving 2 presentations, both of which have been presented internally at Carvana and have received positive feedback:

- Crafting AI: A Developer's Guide to Machine Learning
- The Future of Information Retrieval: A Deep-Dive into RAG

#### Value Proposition

Speaking at ConFoo 2025 positions Carvana as a technical leader in the e-commerce space, particularly in the strategic areas of Machine Learning and AI-powered information retrieval. The two presentations demonstrate our deep expertise in cutting-edge technologies that are crucial for modern automotive retail:

1. The Machine Learning talk showcases Carvana's technical sophistication in developing AI solutions, reinforcing our position as an innovative technology company that can attract and retain top engineering talent.

2. The RAG presentation highlights our leadership in modern information retrieval systems, which are vital for improving customer experience and operational efficiency in large-scale e-commerce operations.

This speaking engagement provides multiple benefits:

- Establishes Carvana's technical credibility in the competitive tech industry
- Creates networking opportunities with potential engineering talent
- Facilitates knowledge sharing that can be brought back to enhance our internal practices
- Increases brand visibility in the international tech community, particularly in the AI/ML space

Beyond speaking, the conference provides invaluable learning opportunities through its diverse technical program. With over 150 sessions covering cutting-edge technologies and enterprise development practices, attendance enables me to:

- Stay current with the latest innovations in AI, cloud computing, and software architecture
- Learn from other industry experts about real-world implementations and challenges
- Gain insights into emerging technologies and methodologies that could benefit Carvana
- Bring back practical knowledge that can be applied to our technical challenges and shared with the broader engineering team

The timing is especially valuable as companies across industries are working to effectively implement AI technologies, positioning Carvana as a thought leader in this transformative period.

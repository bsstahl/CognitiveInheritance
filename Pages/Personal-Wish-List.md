I’ve moved my holiday wish list here from Amazon. I wanted to make it easier for friends and family to shop from a wider range of retailers; including local, independent, or wherever they feel most comfortable. I know Amazon is convenient and familiar, and if that’s your go-to, that’s totally fine. This change is just a small way I’m trying to support more diverse options while keeping things simple for everyone.

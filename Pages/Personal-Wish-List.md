I’ve moved my holiday wish list here from Amazon. I wanted to make it easier for friends and family to shop from a wider range of retailers; including local, independent, or wherever they feel most comfortable. I know Amazon is convenient and familiar, and if that’s your go-to, that’s totally fine. This change is just a small way I’m trying to support more diverse options while keeping things simple for everyone.

### Clothing

I prefer shirts sized *2XLT*, but if that is unavailable, *3XL* will usually work.

* [Long-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt (Carbon Heather)](https://www.carhartt.com/product/K126/loose-fit-heavyweight-long-sleeve-pocket-t-shirt) 
* [Long-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt (Port)](https://www.carhartt.com/product/K126/loose-fit-heavyweight-long-sleeve-pocket-t-shirt)

* [Long-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt (Navy)](https://www.carhartt.com/product/K126/loose-fit-heavyweight-long-sleeve-pocket-t-shirt) 
* [Short-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt (Bluestone)](https://www.carhartt.com/product/K87/loose-fit-heavyweight-short-sleeve-pocket-t-shirt)
* [Short-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt (Dark Spice Red)](https://www.carhartt.com/product/K87/loose-fit-heavyweight-short-sleeve-pocket-t-shirt)
* [Short-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt (Port)](https://www.carhartt.com/product/K87/loose-fit-heavyweight-short-sleeve-pocket-t-shirt)

### Books

Any physical (hard or soft cover) book by Cory Doctorow is great. If I already have that one, I'll happily donate a copy to a school library. E-Books can't be donated, so if you go that route, please only pick from the ones listed.

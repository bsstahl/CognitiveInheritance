<li><p>I thought about what Kincaid said — how Congress tried to fix this.
How the House passed the FAIR Act in 2019 and again in 2022.
And how both times the bill went to the Senate Judiciary Committee and never came back out.
Not even an up-or-down vote.
That's the part that stuck with me. Not the politics. The pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system that keeps disputes out of the public eye</li>
<li>A reform that never gets a public vote</li>
<li>A right that disappears in the fine print</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>My file didn't contain evidence of a crime. There was no smoking gun.
It was a reminder — that some people are still trying to drag this into the light.
And that the rest of us only see the truth when someone decides to look.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have put the case file online in the hope that others will decide to look.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For now, the case remains open.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Congress has tried to fix this. The US House passed the FAIR Act in 2019 and again in 2022.
Both times it went to the Senate Judiciary Committee and never even got a vote.</p>

<li><p>And that's when she looked at me and said, <em>‘You brought me a constitutional injury, Detective. But the law calls it a contract.'</em><br />
I walked out of her office knowing the truth: the system didn't steal people's rights. It asked for them — and the courts handed them over.</p>

<li><p>Back at the office, I opened the file one last time. I noticed a few things I'd forgotten about.
The pamphlet given to me by Dr. Hale for one. A few lines jumped out at me. They read:</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Some contracts include a small window—often 30 days—where you can opt out of the arbitration clause. These opt‑outs usually require sending a short letter by USPS mail to the company. If your contract offers this option, use it every time.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practical advice. It also suggests opting-out even if the time window has passed, just in case.
There was other practical advice too. A must read for anyone who has to sign a contract.</p>

<li><p>I thought about what Kincaid said — how Congress tried to fix this.
How the House passed the FAIR Act in 2019 and again in 2022.
And how both times the bill went to the Senate Judiciary Committee and never came back out.
Not even an up-or-down vote.
That's the part that stuck with me. Not the politics. The pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system that keeps disputes out of the public eye</li>
<li>A reform that never gets a public vote</li>
<li>A right that disappears in the fine print</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>My file didn't contain evidence of a crime. There was no smoking gun.
It was a reminder — that some people are still trying to drag this into the light.
And that the rest of us only see the truth when someone decides to look.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have put the case file online in the hope that others will decide to look.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For now, the case remains open.</p>

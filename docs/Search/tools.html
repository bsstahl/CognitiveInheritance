    <h3>Troubleshooting Information for Machinelearning-ModelBuilder Issue #1027</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2021-04-03 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: tools" class="small" href="../Search/tools.html">tools</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The issue has been resolved. There was an old version of the Extension installed on failing systems that was causing problems with Visual Studio Extensions. Even though the version of the Extension showed as the correct one, an old version was being used. A reinstall of Visual Studio was needed to fix the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There appears to be a problem with the <em>Preview</em> version of the ModelBuilder tool for Visual Studio. This issue has been logged on <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1027">GitHub</a> and I am documenting my findings here in the hope that they will provide some insight into the problem. I will update this post when a solution or workaround is found.</p>
<p>I want to be clear that this problem is in a <strong>preview version</strong>, where problems like this are expected. I don't want the team working on this tooling to think that I am being reproachful of their work in any way. In fact, I want to compliment them and thank them for what is generally an extremely valuable tool.</p>
<p>To reproduce this problem, use this <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bsstahl/06db6cfce2fbbc2e6d455631ffff8108/raw/7466eb3f60fe881300de004954b240950069675d/SourceData_Mocked.csv">Data File</a> to train an <strong>Issue Classification</strong> or <strong>Text Classification</strong> model in the ModelBuilder tool by using the <em>Key</em> column to predict the <em>Value</em> column. The keys have intelligence built into them that are valid predictors of the Value (I didn't design this stuff).</p>
<p>Machines that are unable to complete this task get a error stating <code>Specified label column 'Value' was not found.</code> with a stack trace similar to <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bsstahl/06db6cfce2fbbc2e6d455631ffff8108/raw/52e01628cb6f449fd95091eaa033559a6c4b386e/StackTrace.txt">this</a>.</p>
<p>This process seems to work fine on some machines and not on others. I have a machine that it works on, and one that it fails on, so I will attempt to document the differences here.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that the experience within the tool is <em>VERY DIFFERENT</em> even though it is using the exact same version of the Model Builder.</p>
<h3>From the machine that is able to train the model</h3>
<p><img src="https://gist.github.com/bsstahl/06db6cfce2fbbc2e6d455631ffff8108/raw/b73f673ab81247a529e419e56e1441b6b3cc099b/FunctionalMachine_ModelBuilder_Scenario.png" alt="Scenarios - Functional Machine" /></p>
<h3>From the machine having the failure</h3>
<p><img src="https://gist.github.com/bsstahl/06db6cfce2fbbc2e6d455631ffff8108/raw/b73f673ab81247a529e419e56e1441b6b3cc099b/ProblemMachine_ModelBuilder_Scenario.png" alt="Scenarios - Failing Machine" /></p>
<p>Everything seems to be different. The headline text, the options that can be chosen, and the graphics (or lack thereof). My first reaction when I saw this was to double-check that both machines are actually using the same version of the Model Builder tool.</p>
<h2>Verifying the Version of the Tool</h2>
<p>Spoiler alert: <strong>To the best I am able to verify, both machines are using the same version of the tool</strong>.</p>
<h3>From the machine that is able to train the model</h3>
<p><img src="https://gist.github.com/bsstahl/06db6cfce2fbbc2e6d455631ffff8108/raw/28226dc3fccf0155815f323a484146b7fc662305/FunctionalMachine_ModelBuilder_Version.png" alt="ModelBuilder Tool Version - Functional Machine" /></p>
<h3>From the machine having the failure</h3>
<p><img src="https://gist.github.com/bsstahl/06db6cfce2fbbc2e6d455631ffff8108/raw/28226dc3fccf0155815f323a484146b7fc662305/ProblemMachine_ModelBuilder_Version.png" alt="ModelBuilder Tool Version - Failing Machine" /></p>
<p>My next thought is that I'm not looking at the right thing. Perhaps, <strong>ML.NET Model Builder (Preview)</strong> is not the correct Extension, or maybe the UI for this Extension is loaded separately from the Extension. I can't be sure, but I can't find anything that suggests this is really the case. Perhaps the dev team can give me some insight here.</p>
<h2>Verifying the Region Settings of the Machine</h2>
<p>While these versions are clearly the same, it is obvious from the graphics that the machines have different default date formats. Even though there are no dates in this data file, and both machines were using <em>US English</em>, I changed the Region settings of the problem machine to match that of the functional machine. Predictably, this didn't solve the problem.</p>

<h2>Checking the Versions of Visual Studio</h2>
<p>The biggest difference between the two machines that I can think of, now that the region settings match, is the exact version &amp; configuration of Visual Studio. Both machines have <strong>Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 Preview</strong> versions, but the working machine has version <em>16.9.0 Preview 1.0</em> while the failing machine uses version <em>16.10.0 Preview 1.0</em>. You'll have to forgive me for not wanting to &quot;upgrade&quot; my working machine to the latest preview of Visual Studio, just in case that actually is the problem, though I suspect that is not the issue.</p>

<p>There are also differences in the installed payloads within Visual Studio between the 2 machines. Files containing information about the installations on each of the machines can be found below. These are the files produced when you click the <em>Copy Info</em> button from the Visual Studio <em>About</em> dialog.</p>

<h2>Windows Version</h2>
<p>Another set of differences involve the machines themselves and the versions of Windows they are running. Both machines are running Windows 10, but the working machine runs a <strong>Pro</strong> sku, while the problem machine uses an <strong>Enterprise</strong> sku. Additionally, the machines have different specs, though they are consistent in that they are both underpowered for what I do. I'm going to have to remedy that.</p>
<p>I've included some of the key information about the machines and their OS installations in the files below. None of it seems particularly probative to me.</p>

<h2>Other Things to Check</h2>
<p>There are probably quite a number of additional differences I could look at between the 2 machines. Do you have any ideas about what else I could check to give the dev team the tools they need to solve this problem?</p>

    <h3>Committing to Git from an Azure DevOps Pipeline</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2020-06-17 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: tools" class="small" href="../Search/tools.html">tools</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>There are occasions, such as when working with static website generators, that you'll want to push some changes made in an Azure DevOps pipeline, back into the source Git repository. This process is simple enough, but since I have struggled to get it configured twice now, I am documenting the process here for your use, and my future use.</p>
<p>Azure DevOps pipelines typically contain two parts, although other configurations are possible. The two standards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get sources - gets the information to work with from a Git repository or other source control environment</li>
<li>Agent Job - holds the tasks required to complete the pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll need to take the following steps to configure the interactions between your source control provider and your pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure the <strong>Get sources</strong> section of the pipeline by selecting your source control provider from the list of options and then choosing the repository from the list within that provider. For most providers, you will need to supply credentials with access to the repository, although the pipeline may already have the basic access it needs to read from an Azure DevOps Repo.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/Images/azure_devops_sources.PNG" alt="Azure DevOps Sources" /></p>
<ul>
<li>[optional] Configure an <strong>Agent Job</strong> to perform any cleanup of the repo necessary. When building a static website, I first delete all files from the target directory (the old static website files) so that only the files that are still needed are included in the final deployment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: for all Agent Job steps that involve scripting, I use the <strong>Command Line</strong> task which allows me to execute my scripts in one of the native OS shells (Bash on Linux and macOS and cmd.exe on Windows). You could just as easily use the <strong>Powershell</strong> task, which is cross-platform or any number of other options.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Execute your build process. This is the step that generates the new files that will eventually be committed back into the source repository. Each static website generator has their own method for creating the site, see the documentation for your tooling for specifics. You can also execute custom tools or scripts here that modify files in the repository any way you'd like.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Execute the commit back to the source repo. This is the money step, where everything that has been done to this point is saved in the repository. As with previous steps, I use the <strong>Command Line</strong> task to execute the needed commands. My script is shown below. It is written for the Windows <strong>cmd.exe</strong> shell so commands that start with <em>ECHO</em> are log entries that will be included in the pipeline's execution log to help with troubleshooting and maintenance. This script uses a number of <strong>pipeline variables</strong> which take the form <em>$(variableName)</em> to make configuration easier. The <em>git.email</em> and <em>git.user</em> variables were defined by me in the <em>Variables</em> section of the pipeline, you will need to either configure those variables yourself, or substitute their values in the script. The <em>Build.SourceVersion</em> and <em>Build.SourceVersionMessage</em> variables are supplied by the pipeline and no action was required on my part to create or enable them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting thing to note about this script is the <em>git push</em> command. The full command <code>git push origin HEAD:master</code> is required in this case, rather than just a simple <code>git push</code> because, once the files are downloaded into the pipeline repo, the local repository is disconnected from the remote by the pipeline, possibly as a safety measure. We have to tell the local repo to push back to the remote HEAD, or else the push will fail. I suspect there is a way to tell the pipeline not to disconnect the head, but doing things this way, to my knowledge, has no ill-effects and is simple enough that it isn't really worth the effort for me to find out.</p>
<pre><code>ECHO ** Starting &quot;Git config for user: $(git.user)&quot;
git config --global user.email &quot;$(git.email)&quot;
git config --global user.name &quot;$(git.user)&quot;

ECHO ** Starting &quot;Git add...&quot;
git add .

ECHO ** Starting &quot;Git commit...&quot;
git commit -m &quot;Static site rebuild due to commit $(Build.SourceVersion) '$(Build.SourceVersionMessage)'&quot;

ECHO ** Starting &quot;Git push...&quot;
git push origin HEAD:master

ECHO ** Ending Update remote git repo script
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Finally, we need to give the pipeline user permission to write to the repository. This is where things can get a bit tricky and hard to find. The key configuration area within Azure DevOps can be found by going to the <em>Project Settings</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Azure DevOps repositories, select the <em>Repositories</em> tab and click on the <em>[Projectname] Build Service User</em> in the <em>Users</em> section. This will show a list of permissions that the build service user has. There are 4 that are of interest here: <em>Contribute</em>, <em>Create branch</em>, <em>Create tag</em> and <em>Read</em>. Some of those will probably already be enabled for you. I suspect only the <em>Contribute</em> needs to be added at this time, but I usually make sure all 4 are allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For other repositories, things are even more complicated. Accounts need to be configured on the external source control service so that the Build Service User account has the permissions it needs to push to that repository. This may require an SSH configuration, an Auth token, or any number of other mechanisms depending on the source control provider. See that provider's documentation for the specifics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Update 2022-07-13: There is an additional option that needs to be enabled in the pipeline's <em>Agent Job</em>.
<code>☑ Allow scripts to access the OAuth token</code>
This option must be checked so that the script can acquire the permissions to update the repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are other ways to do all of this of course. One idea that intrigues me that I haven't tried yet is to have the build service submit a pull-request to the remote git repo. This would require an additional approval step before the changes are merged into the repo. For static websites where merging into master is the equivalent of publishing the site, this might give me the opportunity to review the built site before it is actually deployed.</p>
<p>Have you tried this pull-request method, or used this kind of technique with an non-Azure DevOps repo? If so, please let me know about it on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/bsstahl">@bsstahl</a>.</p>

    <h3>Use One Email Alias per Account</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-10-05 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: tools" class="small" href="../Search/tools.html">tools</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>One of the things I do to take better control of my online presence is to use a different email address for every online service that I use. I do this for 3 main reasons:</p>
<h4>1. To Reduce Spam</h4>
<p>If a single alias starts receiving spam, I have a number of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the alias is only used with 1 service, I can create a new alias for that service, update my profile on their website, and delete the old alias</li>
<li>If I no-longer feel like I need to receive email from that service, I can simply delete the alias.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can also determine if a company is selling my email address to spammers. If I have to recreate the alias for a single service more that once or twice due to spam, I can probably assume they are selling my address and take the appropriate steps. Finally, since I am using non-standard email addresses (not my name@, or info@, etc) they are harder for spammers to guess and therefore less susceptible to spam.</p>
<h4>2. To Help Prevent Companies from Tracking Me Across Sites</h4>
<p>One of the ways companies can line-up data about me across multiple services or websites is by my email address. Since many people use the same email address across all services, it can becomes an easy way to be confident that a user of one site, is the same person as the user of another site. It is common today for a single company to have many different brands and properties, and to combine data from all of them (or sell that data to others) in order to learn more about us. As a result, it can be a benefit to our privacy if we use a different email address for each.</p>
<p>That being said, it should be noted that there are a number of other ways companies can track us across sites. To truly do what you can to protect your privacy, there are several other steps you should take to prevent your data from being tracked across sites. Using different email aliases is just one step. Perhaps I will make this the subject of a future post.</p>
<h4>3. To Help Protect Me in Case of Data Breach</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most important reason for using a different email alias for every service is that eventually, my data at one or more of these services, will be compromised. Like companies who legally have access to my data, hackers can use their illegally obtained data to also try to match-up my accounts across multiple breaches, or across multiple sites. For example, a single data set can provide thousands of email/password combinations that can be tried at common sites like Twitter, or at banking, government and other key service sites. It makes sense that we do everything we reasonably can to protect our own information since we can't assume that the companies holding it will be able to protect it forever.</p>
<h4>Pick a Method and Use It</h4>
<p>I recommend using <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/">Outlook.com</a> to create email aliases since that service allows you to create truly distinct aliases and tie them to the same account. Gmail can also create many aliases per account, but they all start with the same alias and just end with a plus sign and then the unique portion of the alias (i.e. myaccount+Guid1@gmail.com and myaccount+otherstuff@gmail.com both work as aliases for myaccount@gmail.com). This is better than nothing, but this pattern is easily identifiable and can be filtered-out using software.</p>
<p>A good pattern is to use GUIDs as the email addresses. That is, an address like B99C3900-157A-45F7-AD20-67EF83ED6776@outlook.com or B99C3900157A45F7AD2067EF83ED6776@outlook.com will almost always be available and is impossible to guess. If you create a number of such aliases and keep them with you, perhaps in a OneNote notebook, you will have functional email addresses to give whenever you are asked for a new one. Then you just need to associate that alias with the service in your notebook so you know not to use it again, and so you know where each alias was used.</p>
<p>Do you have a recommendation of an email service or alias pattern that has worked well for you? Sound off on Twitter using the hashtag <strong>#OneAliasPerAccount</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Office Lens–Magic in a Free App</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-09-30 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: tools" class="small" href="../Search/tools.html">tools</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>While I was working on my <a href="../Posts/Remove-Any-Code-Your-Users-Dont-Care-About.html">last post</a>, I experimented with some visualizations that I thought might help make my point a bit more clearly.  I didn’t end up using them, but the whiteboard exercise that I went through in developing them helped me organize my thoughts, and, I believe, resulted in a better article.</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/Office%20Lens_20150928_155346_processed_thumb.jpg" alt="After Office Lens Processing" /></p>
<p>Once I had drawn-out things the way I wanted them, I did what many people do with a whiteboard, I took a photo of it for my notes. The image above shows what resulted.  As you can see, it isn’t a bad rendering, although certainly not perfect.  The words and structure are both clearly visible and easily readable, but there is nothing all that impressive about it on its own. After all, there are a number of apps out there which can convert a photo of a whiteboard to a similar image. The part where it becomes interesting is when you see the original source photo, shown below.</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/Office%20Lens_20150928_155346_thumb.jpg" alt="Before Office Lens Processing" /></p>
<p>You see, I was working on the post from my hotel room, and my “whiteboard” was the hotel window.  Despite all of the background clutter, I didn’t have to do anything special to get the whiteboard image.  I just did what I always do, open Office Lens, select whiteboard, and take a picture. The app did the rest.  Not only that, but it also, once I saved it, automatically uploaded it to my OneNote so that, by the time I got back to my laptop, I already had a synced copy of it in OneNote ready to be dragged into the appropriate notebook.  Plus, since my phone is set to sync my photos to OneDrive, I already had a copy of both the original image, and the whiteboard image, in my OneDrive Camera Roll. All of this is configurable of course. If you want, Office Lens will just save the images to your phone. But for me, the OneNote integration is a huge time-saver.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, it can also function as a document and business card scanner. Magic!</p>

    <h3>OneNote Notebooks remain “Not Connected”</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-04-08 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: tools" class="small" href="../Search/tools.html">tools</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>File this post under saving you some time that I spent worrying.</p>
<p>Recently, I started having problems with my OneNote notebooks not syncing on my primary laptop. Or at least, that’s what it seemed like was happening.  I depend a lot on OneNote since I use it for all of my notes, on all of my devices, so this was a very big deal for me. The notebooks all had the little red “not-synced” icon on them, so I would request a manual sync.  OneNote went through the process and looked like it was syncing, but at the end, all of the notebooks still had the little red icon on them saying they weren’t current.</p>
<p>The problem turned out to be that I had accidentally changed the radio-button at the top of the sync dialog from “Sync automatically whenever there are changes” to “Work offline - sync only when I click ‘Sync All’”.  As a result, the notebooks always looked as if they were not up-to-date (because they might not have been) and were listed as “Not connected”.  Of course, if I had looked at the last sync time, I would have seen that all notebooks had been synced as of the last manual sync.  Everything was working just fine, I had just changed the setting, making it so my notebooks only synced when I forced it.  By changing the radio button setting back to “Sync automatically…”, everything worked as I expected.</p>

    <p>The next few months are going to be absolutely amazing. We've got some great events coming up in March and April right here in the Valley of the Sun. In addition, I currently have 4 conferences scheduled in 4 different countries on 2 continents.</p>
<h4>AZGiveCamp IX - Presented by Quicken Loans - March 8th-10th</h4>
<p>The most important occasion coming up is the 9th AZGiveCamp Hackathon of Help. This year, we're very fortunate to have Quicken Loans presenting our event and hosting it at their new facility in downtown Phoenix. At AZGiveCamp, Arizona's finest technologists will put their skills to work creating software for some great local charity organizations. We help them help our community by using our skills to create tools that help them further their mission.</p>
<h4>Visual Studio 2019 Arizona Launch - April 16th</h4>
<p>Another fun event for developers in the valley is the Visual Studio 2019 Arizona Launch event being hosted at Galvanize. We'll have some great speakers talking about how Visual Studio 2019 is a more productive, modern, and innovative environment for building software.</p>
<h4>Around the World</h4>
<p>In March, I'll be visiting opposite ends of the east coast of North America.</p>
<p>First, on March 2nd, I'll be attending the always amazing <a href="https://sfsdc.itpand.net/">South Florida Code Camp</a> in Fort Lauderdale.  This event is right up there with the biggest community conferences in the country and is always worth attending. This will be the 7th year I've presented at SoFlaCC. If you're in the area I hope you'll attend.</p>
<p>Later in March, I cross the border into Canada to attend <a href="https://confoo.ca/en/speaker/barry-stahl">ConFoo Montreal</a>. This will be my first trip ever to Montreal so I hope the March weather is kind to this 35 year Phoenix resident.  The event runs from March 13th - 15th and there will be 2 Canadiens games during the time I am there so I should be able to get to at least one of them.</p>
<p>In May I get to do a short tour of Europe, spending 2 weeks at conferences in Budapest, Hungary (<a href="https://craft-conf.com">Craft Conference</a>), and Marbella, Spain (<a href="https://jonthebeach.com/">J on the Beach</a>).  While I have done some traveling in Europe before, I have never been to Spain or Hungary so I am really looking forward to experiencing the history and culture that these two cities have to offer.</p>
<h4>Keep up With Me</h4>
<p>I maintain a list of my presentations, both past and upcoming, on the <a href="../Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html">Community Speaker</a> page of this blog. I also try to document my conference experiences <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl" title="@bsstahl@cognitiveinheritance.com">@bsstahl</a>. If you are going to be attending any of these events, please be sure to ping me and let me know.</p>

    <h3>AZGiveCamp is Breaking the Mold</h3>

    <p>The organizing team of <a href="https://www.azgivecamp.org/">AZGiveCamp</a> recently announced that we would be hosting a one-day <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AZGiveCamp/events/233223409/">Hackathon for Humanitarian Toolbox</a> on Saturday, August 27th, from 8:30 am to 5pm at Ticketmaster in Scottsdale, AZ.  This event is a bit of a departure for us.  We have been looking for ways to evolve the organization to host more and different coding-for-charity events while continuing our mission to to help charitable and non-profit organizations in our community meet their technology needs.  We hope you’ll join us for this first experiment with other event types at AZGiveCamp.</p>
<p>AZGiveCamp’s flagship event is our <em>Hackathon of Help.</em> We have had the privilege of hosting 7 such events in the Valley of the Sun so far, with our 8th scheduled for March of 2017.  These events take up an entire weekend and are designed to put  multiple charity and non-profit organizations together with multiple development teams.  The teams are tasked with taking a project from idea to completion in the course of one weekend.  During these events, participants may chose to camp out at the event facility, stay up and work on their projects, or go home at night, returning to continue the project in the morning until the final turnover on Sunday afternoon.  These events are technology agnostic, with the specific technologies to be used determined by the teams themselves.</p>
<p>By contrast, the AZGiveCamp Humanitarian Toolbox Hackathon will be only a 1-day event.  Participants will work on a single project, the Humanitarian Toolbox (htBox) <a href="http://www.htbox.org">allReady</a> project, for which the technologies, design, and many of the features have already been chosen and implemented.  We will be lending our support to this worthy organization by adding features, upgrading tooling, and writing tests against the existing code base.  This event will not be judged by how many projects we complete, but by how much better-off the project is when we are done.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with Humanitarian Toolbox, they are an organization that sets up projects to assist humanitarian organizations.  Their current project, dubbed <em>allReady</em>, is designed to organize the preparedness campaigns of the Red Cross and other disaster response groups.  The project is implemented in ASP.NET Core MVC with a Cordova client. Participants need to have at least a basic comfort level with one or both of these technologies, along with the appropriate development tools, to be an effective contributor to this project.  Specifics of the required tools can be found on the event page on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AZGiveCamp/events/233223409/">Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll join us at this and future <a href="https://www.azgivecamp.org/">AZGiveCamp</a> events.</p>

    <p>It's AZGiveCamp time again! Our third event is coming up in under 2 weeks, Oct 21st-23rd 2011 at the Park Central Mall (Central Ave. between Thomas and Osborn) in midtown Phoenix. Please sign-up to volunteer as a developer, designer, or analyst on our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AZGiveCamp">Meetup Page</a> or see <a href="https://www.azgivecamp.org">AZGiveCamp.org</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Special appeal: we need graphic designers! If you’re a pro or amateur, it doesn’t matter. Designers are always the most popular people at any GiveCamp!</p>
<p>Those who participated in the last 2 events already know that AZGiveCamp is the local component of a national event where the software development community comes together to support local charities and non-profits by developing or improving their web sites and applications. It's fun, it's agile, it's geeky, and it's good for the community.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic time at the last 2 events and, in Arizona alone, have helped more than 20 non-profits with their development needs. As someone who has now participated in GiveCamps as both a participant and as an organizer, I can honestly say the experience is very, very, worthwhile.</p>
<p>You can find out more about AZGiveCamp at <a href="https://www.azgivecamp.org">https://www.azgivecamp.org</a> and about the national organization at <a href="https://givecamp.org">https://givecamp.org</a>.</p>
<p>I am very excited about this event and look forward to working with all of you at AZGiveCamp III.</p>

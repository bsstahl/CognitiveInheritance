    <blockquote>
<p>An open letter to Senators Kelly and Gallego urging them to oppose any weakening of the protections found in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Senator,</p>
<p>I am reaching out to express my strong opposition to any modifications or repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p>
<p>I am a constituent and a professional with 40 years of experience in distributed systems development, including my work on some of the earliest Internet-based applications at Intel Corporation in Chandler.</p>
<p>Section 230 is a foundational element of the Internet's legal framework and altering it could have profound negative impacts on both free speech and competition in the Internet services space. Here are my primary concerns:</p>
<h4>Impact on Free Speech</h4>
<p>Section 230 provides a crucial liability shield that enables platforms to host diverse content without fear of constant litigation. Repealing or modifying this section would lead to increased censorship as platforms become overly cautious in moderating content. This could stifle free expression and create a chilling effect, where administrators are forced to censor, or shut down operations altogether, out of fear that perfectly legal speech might lead to liabilities for the platform. The open dialogue and exchange of ideas that are core to our democratic principles would be severely compromised.</p>
<p>In addition, modifying or even eliminating Section 230 wouldn't stop bad actors from spreading harmful content, as they are adept at exploiting loopholes and adapting to new platforms. A much better approach lies in addressing the behavior of the bad actors themselves, not transferring the responsibility onto Internet platform administrators. The issues that people seek to solve by modifying Section 230 simply would not be improved by this legislation.</p>
<h4>Impact on Competition</h4>
<p>The current protections encourage innovation and allow new entrants to compete in the Internet services space. Without these protections, smaller companies and startups would face significant barriers to entry due to the threat of costly litigation and the need to support large staff of content moderators. This could lead to an even greater consolidation of power among a few large corporations, reducing competition and limiting consumer choice. Furthermore, these same increased operational costs could stifle innovation and slow the development of new technologies.</p>
<p>As someone who has been deeply involved in the growth and evolution of Internet technologies, I believe that maintaining the integrity of Section 230 is essential for fostering a vibrant, competitive, and open Internet. I urge you to consider the potential ramifications of modifying this critical piece of legislation and to oppose any efforts that would undermine its foundational principles.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I appreciate your service to our state and your consideration of my perspective. Please feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss this issue further.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Barry Stahl<br/>
Software Engineer<br/>

    <br/><br/>
    <p>The implosion of Twitter and my subsequent move to <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bsstahl">the Fediverse</a> has me reviewing all of my social media activity.</p>
<p>A few of the things I've looked at, and continue to investigate, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and why I use each platform</li>
<li>How has my activity changed over time</li>
<li>What previous statements I've made should be corrected, amended, or otherwise revisited</li>
</ul>
<p>The revisiting of previous statements will likely happen either on the platform where they originated, or via microblog commentary <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl" title="@bsstahl@cognitiveinheritance.com">@bsstahl</a>. The rest of the analysis can be found here for everyone's benefit and comment. Of course, all comments, as indicated below, should be directed to my microblog <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl" title="@bsstahl@cognitiveinheritance.com">@bsstahl</a>.</p>
<p>My platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cognitiveinheritance.com">My Blog</a>:
<ul>
<li>How I use it: Long form posts, usually technical in nature, that describe a concept or methodology.</li>
<li>Future Plans: I hope to continue to use this platform for a long time and would like to be more active. However, I have said that many times and never been able to keep-up a good cadence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Microblogging <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a> but previously on Twitter:
<ul>
<li>How I use it:
<ul>
<li>Real-time communication about events such as tech conferences with other attendees</li>
<li>Keeping in-touch with friends I met at events, usually without even having to directly interact</li>
<li>Asking for input on concepts or ideas on how to do/use a tool or technology</li>
<li>Asking for comments on my blog posts or presentations</li>
<li>Promoting my or other speakers/writers posts or talks, especially when I attend a talk at a conference</li>
<li>Publishing links to the code and slide-decks for my conference talks</li>
<li>Publicly whining about problems with commercial products or services</li>
<li>Making the occasional bad joke or snarky remark, usually at the expense of some celebrity, athlete or business</li>
<li>Posting individual photos of people I know or places I go</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future Plans: With the move to the Fediverse, I may try to focus more completely on technology on this platform. Perhaps sports-related stuff should go elsewhere, maybe a photo-blog site like <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">PixelFed</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facebook:
<ul>
<li>How I use it:
<ul>
<li>Private to only family members or friends I <em>actually know</em></li>
<li>Posting Photos of family and friends to a limited audience</li>
<li>Check-ins to places I'm at for future reference, especially restaurants</li>
<li>Posting political commentary and social memes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future Plans: I want a place for this that is not a walled-garden like Facebook. I feel like private communities could be run on <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> or other Fediverse servers like <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">PixelFed</a>. There are a few possibilities I'm exploring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flickr:
<ul>
<li>How I use it:
<ul>
<li>Paid &quot;professional&quot; account where I keep my off-site backup of every digital photo I've ever taken, plus some scanned photos that were &quot;born analog&quot;, in full-size</li>
<li>A public photostream of my favorite photos that are not family or friends</li>
<li>A restricted (to family and friends) photostream of photos of family or friends</li>
<li>Hosting of photos for my photoblog sites including <a href="http://GiveEmHellDevils.com">GiveEmHellDevils.com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future Plans: Most of this will remain though I may syphon-off specific elements to other, more federated communities. For example, the restricted photostream could move to a <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">PixelFed</a> server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LinkedIn:
<ul>
<li>How I use it: A professional network of people I actually know in the technology space. I don't accept requests from people I have never met, including (especially?) recruiters. If I ever need to find a job again, it will be through referrals from people I know.</li>
<li>Future Plans: I'd like to do a better job of posting my appropriate content here, perhaps as links from my blog. Of course, that would require more posts on my blog (see above). Other than that, I don't expect any changes here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>YouTube:
<ul>
<li>How I use it:
<ul>
<li>In the past, I used it to post videos of family and friends, though now those are usually posted privately via Flickr or Facebook</li>
<li>Most of the time, I post videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCo2TFzFXPTQ5qIZTbbzFNcJL348fl6uO">my technical presentations</a>, or other presentations to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCo2TFzFXPTQKUxyd61Rb9nN1d6jfEbAU">local user groups</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future Plans: Continue to share videos of technical content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instagram
<ul>
<li>How I use it: To publish photos from my <a href="http://GiveEmHellDevils.com">GiveEmHellDevils.com</a> photoblog.</li>
<li>Future Plans: I would prefer to move this to a Fediverse service like <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">PixelFed</a> that is not a walled-garden. I may start by adding a second stream using the Fediverse, and see what happens. If things go in the right direction, I may be able to eliminate Instagram.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GitHub:
<ul>
<li>How I use it:
<ul>
<li>A public repository of my Open-Source (FOSS) projects and code samples.</li>
<li>A public repository of those FOSS projects that I contribute to via Pull-Request (PR)</li>
<li>The hosting platform for my <a href="https://cognitiveinheritance.com">Blog Site</a> and my <a href="http://GiveEmHellDevils.com">GiveEmHellDevils.com</a> photoblog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future Plans: No changes expected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Azure DevOps
<ul>
<li>How I use it:
<ul>
<li>A private repository of my private code projects</li>
<li>A private repository of the source material for my presentation slides</li>
<li>A private repository of my many random experiments with code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future Plans: No changes expected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Azure Websites
<ul>
<li>How I use it:
<ul>
<li>To publish the individual slide-decks for my presentations as listed on <a href="https://cognitiveinheritance.com/Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html">my blog site</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future Plans: No changes expected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TikTok
<ul>
<li>How I use it: I don't</li>
<li>Future Plans: None</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <p>Joe Guadagno has posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://weblogs.asp.net/jguadagno/archive/2008/12/11/the-best-of-pdc-in-phx.aspx">his summary of The Best of PDC in PHX</a>. This was a great event and I want to make sure those who put it together, spoke, and sponsored it know we are tremendously appreciative of their efforts.  This includes: <a href="https://www.josephguadagno.net/">Joseph Guadagno</a>, <a href="https://www.scottcate.com/">Scott Cate</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/bags/">Rob Bagby</a> as well as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rht.com/">Robert Half Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.teksystems.com/">TekSystems</a> and <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>.</p>
<p>I think that the best summary I can give of my experience at this event is through the tweets I sent in real-time while there.  Below, are what I think are my tweets most representative of the experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first I hated that C# didn't have optional params. Now I know that life is better w/o them. Sorry C# 4.0.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo Center has much more comfy chairs than most conference centers #PDCPHX</p>
<p>&quot;...and I say 'thingey' in the most technical way possible.&quot; - Rob Bagby #phxpdc</p>
<p>Did Rob Bagby just invoke Don Box? #phxpdc</p>
<p>XBox at the bottom of the hierarchy of needs Rob? #phxpdc</p>
<p>I don't envy @scottcate having to follow Rob Bagby at #phxpdc</p>
<p>Rob Bagby on Intellisense: &quot;I just got nerdly goosebumps&quot;. #phxpdc</p>
<p>Notepad!!! #phxpdc</p>
<p>To the non-dev-geek members of my family: no I will not stfu about #phxpdc</p>
<p>I always feel so dirty after demos involving json. #phxpdc</p>
<p>Tunneling an HTTP Put through a Post seems like a massive cluge. #phxpdc</p>
<p>W00t, I finally got @stupiderr on Twitter!</p>
<p>Declarative programming, what a concept... #phxpdc</p>
<p>Rob Bagby is weakening on his anti-Twitter stance. Hit him now while his defenses are down. Resistance is Futile. #phxpdc</p>
<p>&quot;automagically&quot; is a word whose time has come and gone.</p>
<p>It's important for me to know what's available in the Ajax world, but I have no desire to live there anymore. Silverlight FTW!</p>
<p>OK, let's talk Silverlight! #phxpdc</p>
<p>@stupiderr &quot;genie blink&quot;? I am so uncool!</p>
<p>Azure Party Planning Services now live! #phxpdc</p>
<p>Rob Bagby can give presentations on the same topic 2 days in a row that are totally different and both awesome. #phxpdc</p>
<p>#phxpdc Crowd reference to &quot;Hailstorm&quot;. Nicely done sir.</p>
<p>Imo the best example of cloud service bus at PDC was in the Don Box/Chris Anderson keynote. #phxpdc</p>
<p>He already said, &quot;you don't need schema&quot;... #phxpdc</p>
<p>First &quot;Animal House&quot; reference of the day goes to Rob. #phxpdc</p>
<p>I don't like the SOAP API for SDS right now. SQL string queries are so 1990s. #phxpdc</p>
<p>Using Linq to project query results into a POCO is awesome. #phxpdc</p>
<p>@steeleprice it means CLR Obj to me. That Linq trick should work in VB too. But then again, I'll always be VB at heart.</p>
<p>@scottcate, @jguadagno, and Rob were all amazing today! Great event! Thank you all!</p>

    <p>Day 2 was a more focused day for me at PDC 2008. After attending the morning keynotes, which included the first peeks at Windows 7 features as well as a terrific (as always) code-only presentation on programming against the cloud by Don Box and Chris Anderson, I headed over to the hands-on-labs where I spent the rest of the day working with Azure and creating applications that run in the cloud. I also received my Azure key and began the process of setting up a virtual machine to house the Azure tools.</p>
<h3>Real-Time Updates on Social Media</h3>
<p>Just a reminder that much of what is happening here at the PDC is being posted in real-time (or close to it) on social media. My updates can now be found <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl" title="@bsstahl@cognitiveinheritance.com">@bsstahl</a>.</p>
<h3>Keynotes</h3>
<p>Day 2 keynotes focused on the client side of Windows development. Not surprisingly, this included Windows 7 and WPF development improvements as well as Silverlight and ASP.NET development. Some things that caught my attention in the keynotes included features of Windows 7 like its ability to &quot;live&quot; on a domain, but still participate in a &quot;Home Group&quot; when your work laptop is brought home.  Multi-monitor support also looks to be vastly improved including the ability to work multi-monitor in a remote desktop session. Scott Guthrie also introduced a number of new controls and tools for developing applications in WPF and Silverlight including a Ribbon control that appears intended to make your WPF apps look like Windows Forms apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/2984522640_4474ab254e.jpg" alt="Chris Anderson and Don Box Keynoting PDC2008" /></p>
<p>The 2nd Keynote of the day was Don Box and Chris Anderson's fantastic presentation on developing applications that bring cloud computing into the enterprise. Clearly the most engaging of all of the Microsoft speakers, this duo put together, over the course of the 1.5 hour session, a series of services that ran both in the cloud and within the firewall, and linked the two securely, but in real-time.  You would not be wasting your time if you were to view the video of this keynote online.</p>
<h3>Hands-On Labs</h3>
<p>The remainder of my day, after lunch, was spent in the hands-on labs working through the prescriptive samples provided by Microsoft for their Azure product. I was able to complete the first two of these labs which detailed the process of creating websites and services in the cloud that used local-storage and queues to perform a number of relatively simple tasks. These labs clearly answered my question from yesterday morning, with the answer that I expected. That is, an Azure &quot;Web Role&quot; is a web page or SOAP service that runs in the cloud. As such, everything (that I can think of) that I might need to run on my own servers, can be outsourced into the cloud, to provide the availability of virtually unlimited scale with amazing reliability. The still-unanswered question here is price, but since the CTP is free, I will continue to move in this direction until I find a reason to change course.</p>
<h3>Day 3 Preview</h3>
<p>Day 3 looks to be futures day, with the keynote focusing on Microsoft Research properties and technologies. Watch social media for all the action as it occurs.</p>

    <p>I'm getting ready to head over to the Los Angeles Convention Center for the start of PDC 08. For those not here, you can watch the Ray Ozzie keynotes live on the web via <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20081026/pdc-08-keynote-live-streams/">http://www.istartedsomething.com/20081026/pdc-08-keynote-live-streams/</a> .  The Microsofties on Twitter are doing a great job of pumping-up the excitement for these keynotes with lots of comments on the media embargos and quips about how important this event is to Microsoft's future. I'll be publishing more information as it becomes available.</p>

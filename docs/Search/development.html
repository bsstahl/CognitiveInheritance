    <h3>Identifying the Extraneous Publishing AntiPattern</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2022-08-08 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>What do you do when a dependency of one of your components needs data, ostensibly from your component, that your component doesn't actually need itself?</p>
<p>Let's think about an example. Suppose our problem domain (the big black box in the drawings below) uses some data from 3 different data sources (labeled Source A, B &amp; C in the drawings). There is also a downstream dependency that needs data from the problem domain, as well as from sources B &amp; C. Some of the data required by the downstream dependency are not needed by, or owned by, the problem domain.</p>
<p>There are 2 common implementations discussed now, and 1 slightly less obvious one discussed later in this article. We could:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pass-through the needed values on the output from our problem domain. This is the default option in many environments.</li>
<li>Force the downstream to take additional dependencies on sources B &amp; C</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: In the worst of these cases, the data from one or more of these sources is not needed at all in the problem domain.</p>
<h2>Option 1 - Increase Stamp Coupling</h2>
<p>The most common choice is for the problem domain to publish all data that it is system of record for, as well as passing-through data needed by the downstream dependencies from the other sources. Since we know that a dependency needs the data, we simply provide it as part of the output of the problem domain system.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Reducing Stamp Coupling - Coupled Data Feed - 800x314.png" alt="Coupled Data Feed" /></p>
<h3>Option 1 Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>The downstream systems only needs to take a dependency on a single data source.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 1 Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Violates the Single Responsibility Principle because the problem domain may need to change for reasons the system doesn't care about. This can occur if a upstream producer adds or changes data, or a downstream consumer needs additional or changed data.</li>
<li>The problem domain becomes the de-facto system of record for data it doesn't own. This may cause downstream consumers to be blocked by changes important to the consumers but not the problem domain. It also means that the provenance of the data is obscured from the consumer.</li>
<li>Problems incurred by upstream data sources are exposed in the problem domain rather than in the dependent systems, irrespective of where the problem occurs or whether that problem actually impacts the problem domain. That is, the owners of the system in the problem domain become the &quot;one neck to wring&quot; for problems with the data, regardless of whether the problem is theirs, or they even care about that data.</li>
</ul>
<p>I refer to this option as an implementation of the <strong>Extraneous Publishing Antipattern</strong> (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jcnusz">John Nusz</a> for the naming suggestion). When this antipattern is used it will eventually cause significant problems for both the problem domain and its consumers as they evolve independently and the needs of each system change. The problem domain will be stuck with both their own requirements, and the requirements of their dependencies. The dependent systems meanwhile will be stuck waiting for changes in the upstream data provider. These changes will have no priority in that system because the changes are not needed in that domain and are not cared about by that product's ownership.</p>
<p>The relationship between two components created by a shared data contract is known as <strong>stamp coupling</strong>. Like any form of coupling, we should attempt to minimize it as much as possible between components so that we don't create hard dependencies that reduce our agility.</p>
<h2>Option 2 - Multiplicative Dependencies</h2>
<p>This option requires each downstream system to take a dependency on every system of record whose data it needs, regardless of what upstream data systems may already be utilizing that data source.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Reducing Stamp Coupling - Direct Dependencies - 800x544.png" alt="Direct Dependencies" /></p>
<h3>Option 2 Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each system publishes only that information for which it is system of record, along with any necessary identifiers.</li>
<li>Each dependency gets its data directly from the system of record without concern for intermediate actors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 2 Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>A combinatorial explosion of dependencies is possible since each system has to take dependencies on every system it needs data from. In some cases, this means that the primary systems will have a huge number of dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is nothing inherently wrong with having a large number of repeated dependencies within the broader system, it can still cause difficulties in managing the various products when the dependency graph starts to get unwieldy. We've seen similar problems in package-management and other dependency models before. However, there is a more common problem when we prematurely optimize our systems. If we optimize prematurely, we can create artifacts that we need to support forever, that create unnecessary complexity. As a result, I tend to use option 2 until the number of dependencies starts to grow. At that point, when the dependency graph starts to get out of control, we should look for another alternative.</p>
<h2>Option 3 - Shared Aggregation Feed</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there is a third option that may not be immediately apparent. We can get the best of both worlds, and limit the impact of the disadvantages described above, by moving the aggregation of the data to a separate system. In fact, depending on the technologies used, this aggregation may be able to be done using an infrastructure component that is a low-code solution less likely to have reliability concerns.</p>
<p>In this option, each system publishes only the data for which it is system of record, as in option 1 above. However, instead of every system having to take a direct dependency on all of the upstream systems, a separate component is used to create a shared feed that represents the aggregation of the data from all of the sources.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Reducing Stamp Coupling - Aggregated Data Feed - 800x276.png" alt="Aggregated Data Feed" /></p>
<h3>Option 3 Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each system publishes only that information for which it is system of record, along with any necessary identifiers.</li>
<li>The downstream systems only needs to take a dependency on a single data source.</li>
<li>A shared ownership can be arranged for the aggregation source that does not put the burden entirely on a single domain team.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 3 Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>The aggregation becomes the de-facto system of record for data it doesn't own, though that fact is anticipated and hopefully planned for. The ownership of this aggregation needs to be well-defined, potentially even shared among the teams that provide data for the aggregation. This still means though that the provenance of the data is obscured from the consumer.</li>
<li>Problems incurred by upstream data sources are exposed in the aggregator rather than in the dependent systems, irrespective of where the problem occurs. That is, the owners of the aggregation system become the &quot;one neck to wring&quot; for problems with the data. However, as described above, that ownership can be shared among the teams that own the data sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that in any case, regardless of implementation, a mechanism for correlating data across the feeds will be required. That is, the entity being described will need either a common identifier, or a way to translate the identifiers from one system to the others so that the system can match the data for the same entities appropriately.</p>
<p>You'll notice that the aggregation system described in this option suffers from some of the same disadvantages as the other two options. The biggest difference however is that the sole purpose of this tool is to provide this aggregation. As a result, we handle all of these drawbacks in a domain that is entirely built for this purpose. Our business services remain focused on our business problems, and we create a special domain for the purpose of this data aggregation, with development processes that serve that purpose. In other words, we avoid expanding the definition of our problem domain to include the data aggregation as well. By maintaining each component's single responsibility in this way, we have the best chance of remaining agile, and not losing velocity due to extraneous concerns like unnecessary data dependencies.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways we can perform the aggregation described in option 3.  Certain databases such as MongoDb and CosmosDb provide mechanisms that can be used to aggregate multiple data elements. There are also streaming data implementations which include tools for joining multiple streams, such as Apache Kafka's <em>kSQL</em>. In future articles, I will explore some of these methods for minimizing stamp coupling and avoiding the Extraneous Publishing AntiPattern.</p>

    <h3>Meta-Abstraction -- You Ain't Gonna Need It!</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2020-05-18 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <blockquote>
<p>When we look at the abstractions in our applications, we should see a description of the capabilities of our applications, not the capabilities of the abstraction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s start this discussion by looking at an example of a simple repository.</p>
<div class="lang-csharp editor-colors"><div style="color:Black;background-color:White;"><pre>
<span style="color:Blue;">public</span> <span style="color:Blue;">interface</span> IMeetingReadRepository
{
    IEnumerable&lt;Meeting&gt; GetMeetings(DateTime start, DateTime end);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is easy to see the capability being described by this abstraction – any implementation of this interface will have the ability to load a collection of Meeting objects that occur within a given timeframe. There are still some unknown details of the implementation, but the capabilities are described reasonably well.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at a different implementation of the Repository pattern.</p>
<div class="lang-csharp editor-colors"><div style="color:Black;background-color:White;"><pre>
<span style="color:Blue;">public</span> <span style="color:Blue;">interface</span> IReadRepository&lt;T&gt;
{
    IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Get(Func&lt;T, <span style="color:Blue;">bool</span>&gt; predicate);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can still see that something is going to be loaded using this abstraction, we just don’t know what, and we don’t know what criteria will be used.</p>
<p>This 2nd implementation is a more flexible interface. That is, we can use this interface to describe many different repositories that do many different things. All we have described in this interface is that we have the ability to create something that will load an entity. In other words, we have described our abstraction but said very little about the capabilities of the application itself. In this case, we have to look at a specific implementation to see what it loads, but we still have no idea what criteria can be used to load it.</p>
<div class="lang-csharp editor-colors"><div style="color:Black;background-color:White;"><pre>
<span style="color:Blue;">public</span> <span style="color:Blue;">class</span> MeetingReadRepository : IReadRepository&lt;Meeting&gt;
{
    IEnumerable&lt;Meeting&gt; Get(Func&lt;Meeting, <span style="color:Blue;">bool</span>&gt; predicate);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We could extend this class with a method that specifically loads meetings by start and end date, but then that method is not on the abstraction so it cannot be used without leaking the details of the implementation to the application.  The only way to implement this pattern in a way that uses the generic interface, but still fully describes the capabilities of the application is to use both methods described above. That is, we implement the specific repository, using the generic repository – layering abstraction on top of abstraction, as shown below.</p>
<div class="lang-csharp editor-colors"><div style="color:Black;background-color:White;"><pre>
<span style="color:Blue;">public</span> <span style="color:Blue;">interface</span> IMeetingReadRepository : IReadRepository&lt;Meeting&gt;
{
    IEnumerable&lt;Meeting&gt; GetMeetings(DateTime start, DateTime end);
}

<span style="color:Blue;">public</span> <span style="color:Blue;">class</span> MeetingReadRepository : IMeetingReadRepository
{
    IEnumerable&lt;Meeting&gt; GetMeetings(DateTime start, DateTime end)
        =&gt; Get(m =&gt; m.Start &gt;= start &amp;&amp; m.Start &lt; end)

    <span style="color:Green;">// TODO: Implement</span>
    IEnumerable&lt;Meeting&gt; Get(Func&lt;Meeting, <span style="color:Blue;">bool</span>&gt; predicate)
        =&gt; <span style="color:Blue;">throw</span> <span style="color:Blue;">new</span> NotImplementedException();
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Is this worth the added complexity? It seems to me that as application developers we should be concerned about describing and building our applications in the simplest, most maintainable and extensible way possible. To do so, we need seams in our applications in the form of abstractions. However, we generally do not need to build frameworks on which we build those abstractions. Framework creation is an entirely other topic with an entirely different set of concerns.</p>
<p>I think it is easy to see how quickly things can get overly-complex when we start building abstractions on top of our own abstractions in our applications. Using Microsoft or 3rd party frameworks is fine when appropriate, but there is generally no need to build your own frameworks, especially within your applications. In the vast majority of cases, <a href="../Search/yagni.html">YAGNI</a>.</p>
<p>Did I miss something here? Do you have a situation where you feel it is worth it to build a framework, or even part of a framework, within your applications. Please let me know about it <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>The Value of Flexibility</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2019-02-14 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Have you ever experienced that feeling you get when you need to extend an existing system and there is an extension point that is exactly what you need to build on?</p>
<p>For example, suppose I get a request to extend a system so that an additional action is taken whenever a new user signs-up.  The system already has an event message that is published whenever a new user signs-up that contains all of the information I need for the new functionality.  All I have to do is subscribe a new microservice to this event message, and have that service take the new action whenever it receives a message. Boom! Done.</p>
<p>Now think about the converse. The many situations we’ve all experienced where there is no extension point. Or maybe there is an extension mechanism in place but it isn’t quite right; perhaps an event that doesn’t fire on exactly the situation you need, or doesn’t contain the data you require for your use case and you have to build an entirely new data support mechanism to get access to the bits you need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost to “go live” is only a small percentage of the lifetime total cost of ownership. – Andy Kyte for Gartner Research, 30 March 2010</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some conflicting principles at work here, but for me, these situations expose the critical importance of flexibility and extensibility in our application architectures.  After all, maintenance and extension are the two greatest costs in a typical application’s life-cycle. I don’t want to build things that I don’t yet need because the likelihood is that I will never need them (see <a href="..//Search/yagni.html">YAGNI</a>). However, I don’t want to preclude myself from building things in the future by making decisions that cripple flexibility. I certainly don’t want to have to do a full system redesign ever time I get a new requirement.</p>
<p>For me, this leads to a principle that I like to follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I value <strong>Flexibility</strong> over <strong>Optimization</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with the principles described in the Agile Manifesto that this is modeled after, this does not eliminate the item on the right in favor of the item on the left, it merely states that the item on the left is valued more highly.  This makes a ton of sense to me in this case because it is much easier to scale an application by adding instances, especially in these heady days of cloud computing, than it is to modify and extend it. I cannot add a feature by adding another instance of a service, but I can certainly overcome a minor or even moderate inefficiency by doing so. Of course, there is a cost to that as well, but typically that cost is far lower, especially in the short term, than the cost of maintenance and extension.</p>
<p>So, how does this manifest (see what I did there?) in practical terms?</p>
<p>For me, it means that I allow seams in my applications that I may not have a functional use for just yet. I may not build anything on those seams, but they exist and are available for use as needed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separating the tiers of my applications for loose-coupling using the Strategy and Repository patterns</li>
<li>Publishing events in event-driven systems whenever it makes sense, regardless of the number of subscriptions to that event when it is created</li>
<li>Including all significant data in event messages rather than just keys</li>
</ul>
<p>There are, of course, dangers here as well. It can be easy to fire events whenever we would generally issue a logging message.  Events should be limited to those in the problem domain (Domain Events), not application events. We can also reach a level of absurdity with the weight of each message. As with all things, a balance needs to be struck. In determining that balance, I value Flexibility over Optimization whenever it is reasonable and possible to do so.</p>
<p>Do you feel differently? If so, let me know <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>Back to Basics–the Double Data Type</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2019-02-12 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>What is the result of converting a value that is close to, but not at, the maximum value of an Int64 from a double to a long (Int64)?  That is, what would be the result of an expression like:</p>
<p><code>(long)((double)(Int64.MaxValue – 1))</code></p>
<ol>
<li>9223372036854775806 (2<sup>63</sup>-2, the correct value numerically)</li>
<li>-9223372036854775808 or another obviously incorrect value</li>
<li>OverflowException</li>
<li>Any of the above</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the framing of the question it is probably clear that the correct answer is &quot;D&quot;. It is possible, depending on the hardware details and current state of your system, for any of the 3 possible outcomes.  Why is this and what can we do to be sure that the results of our floating-point operations are what we expect them to be?</p>
<p>Before we go into the ways we can modify the behavior of our operations, let's take a look at the two data types in question, <strong>Int64</strong> and <strong>Double</strong>.</p>
<p>An Int64 value, also known as a long, is a fairly straightforward storage mechanism that uses 63 bits for the value and 1 bit to represent the sign.  Negative numbers are stored in twos-complement form to make mathematical operations simpler.  The result is that the Int64 type can store, with perfect fidelity, any integral value between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807.</p>
<p>The Double data type on the other hand is far more complex. It requires storage for continuous values, not just integers. As a result, the Double data type uses 52 bits to store the mantissa (value), 11 bits to store the exponent (order of magnitude) and the remaining bit of the 64-bit structure to store the sign. Both the exponent and mantissa are shifted by a few bits based on some fairly safe assumptions.  This gives us a range of values for the exponent of -1023 to 1024 and a little more than 52 bits of fidelity in the mantissa.</p>
<p>It is this difference in fidelity; 63 bits for Int64 and roughly 52 bits for Doubles, that can cause us problems when converting between the two types.  As long as the integer value can be stored in less than 52 bits (value &lt; 4503599627370495) values can be converted back and forth between Int64 and Double without any data loss. However, as soon as the values cannot be represented completely in 52 bits, data loss is likely to occur.</p>
<p>To store such a value in a Double data type, the exponent is adjusted higher and the best available value for the mantissa is found.  When converted back to Int64, this value will be rounded automatically by the framework into the closest integer value. This resulting value may, or may not, be exactly the same as the original value.  To see an example of this, execute the following code in your favorite C# environment:</p>
<p><code>Console.WriteLine((long)9223372036854773765.0);</code></p>
<p>If your system is like mine, you’ll get an answer that is not the same as the original value. On my system, I get the result <strong>9223372036854773760</strong>. It is said that this integer does not “round-trip” since it cannot be converted into a Double and then back to an integer.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the rounding that is required for this conversion can be unsafe under certain conditions. On my machine, if the values get within 512 of Int64.MaxValue, even though they don’t exceed it, attempting the conversion may result in an invalid result, or an <strong>OverflowException</strong>. Even performing the operation without overflow checking using the <strong>unchecked</strong> keyword or compiler switch doesn't improve things since, if done unchecked, any overflow in the operation will result in an incorrect value rather than an exception. I prefer the exception in this kind of situation so I generally keep overflow checking on.</p>
<p>The key takeaway for me is that just checking to make certain that a Double value is less than Int64.MaxValue is not enough to guarantee it will convert without error, and certainly does not guarantee the accuracy of any such conversion. Only integer values below 52 bits can be accurately converted into Int64 values.</p>
<p>It is always best to avoid type conversions if possible, but if you are in a situation where it is necessary to convert from large Double values into Integers, I recommend trying some experiments in your production environment to see what range of values will convert accurately. I also highly recommend including very large integers, approaching or at Int64.MaxValue as test data against any method that accepts Int64 values.  Values that are very large in the negative direction (nearing Int64.MinValue) are also good candidates to be used as test data in these methods.</p>
<p>I’ve attached a number of resources below that I used in my research to produce this article, and to fix the bug I caused doing this kind of conversion.  If you have run into this situation and come up with an interesting way of handling it, or if the results of your conversions are different than mine, please let me know about it <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>Programmers -- Take Responsibility for Your AI’s Output</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2018-03-16 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <blockquote>
<p><strong>plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose</strong> – <strong>The more that things change, the more they stay the same</strong>. – Rush (and others <img src="..//Images/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" alt="Winking smile" /> )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2013 I <a href="../Posts/Programmers-Take-Responsibility-for-Your-Programe28099s-Output.html">wrote</a> that programmers needed to take responsibility for the output of their computer programs.  In that article, I advised developers that the output of their system, no matter how “random” or “computer generated”, was still their responsibility. I suggested that we cannot cop out by claiming  that the output of our programs is not our fault simply because we didn’t directly instruct the computer to issue that specific result.</p>
<p>Today, we have a similar problem, only the stakes are much, much, higher.</p>
<p>In the world of 2018, our algorithms are being used in police work and inside other government agencies to know where and when to deploy resources, and to decide who is and isn’t worthy of an opportunity. Our programs are being used in the private sector to make decisions from trading stocks to hiring, sometimes at a scale and speed that puts us all at risk of economic events. These tools are being deployed by information brokers such as Facebook and Google to make predictions about how best to steal the most precious resource we have, our time.  Perhaps scariest of all, these algorithms may be being used to make decisions that have permanent and irreversible results, such as with drone strikes.  We  simply have no way of knowing the full breadth of decisions that AIs are making on our behalf today.  If those algorithms are biased in any way, the decisions made by these programs will be biased, potentially in very serious ways and with serious results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we take all available steps to recognize and eliminate the biases in our systems, we can minimize the likelihood of our tools producing output that we did not expect or that violates our principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the machines used to execute these algorithms are bias-free of course.  A computer has no prejudices and no desires of its own.  However, as we all know, decision-making  tools learn what we teach them.  We cannot completely teach these algorithms free of our own biases.  It simply cannot be done since all of our data is colored by our existing biases.  Perhaps the best known example of bias in our data is in crime data used for policing. If we send police to where there is most often crime, we will be sending them to the same places we’ve sent them in the past, since generally, crime involves having a police office in the location to make an arrest. Thus, any biases we may have had in the past about where to send police officers, will be represented in our data sets about crime.</p>
<p>While we may never be able to eliminate biases completely, there are things that we can do to minimize the impact of the biases we are training into our algorithms.  If we take all available steps to recognize and eliminate the biases in our systems, we can minimize the likelihood of our tools producing output that we did not expect or that violates our principles.</p>
<h5>Know that the algorithm is biased</h5>
<p>We need to accept the fact that there is no way to create a completely bias-free algorithm.  Any dataset we provide to our tools will inherently have some bias in it.  This is the nature of our world.  We create our datasets based on history and our history, intentionally or not, is full of bias.  All of our perceptions and understandings are colored by our cognitive biases, and the same is true for the data we create as a result of our actions.  By knowing and accepting this fact, that our data is biased, and therefore our algorithms are biased, we take the first step toward neutralizing the impacts of those biases.</p>
<h5>Predict the possible biases</h5>
<p>We should do everything we can to predict what biases may have crept into our data and how they may impact the decisions the model is making, even if that bias is purely theoretical.  By considering what biases could potentially exist, we can watch for the results of those biases, both in an automated and manual fashion.</p>
<h5>Train “fairness” into the model</h5>
<p>If a bias is known to be present in the data, or even likely to be present, it can be accounted for by defining what an unbiased outcome might look like and making that a training feature of the algorithm.  If we can reasonably assume that an unbiased algorithm would distribute opportunities among male and female candidates at the same rate as they apply for the opportunity, then we can constrain the model with the expectation that the rate of  accepted male candidates should be within a statistical tolerance of  the rate of male applicants.  That is, if half of the applicants are men then men should receive roughly half of the opportunities.  Of course, it will not be nearly this simple to define fairness for most algorithms, however every effort should be made.</p>
<h5>Be Open About What You’ve Built</h5>
<p>The more people understand how you’ve examined your data, and the assumptions you’ve made, the more confident they can be that anomalies in the output are not a result of systemic bias. This is the most critical when these decisions have significant consequences to peoples’ lives.  A good example is in prison sentencing. It is unconscionable to me that we allow black-box algorithms to make sentencing decisions on our behalf.  These models should be completely transparent and subject to our analysis and correction.  That they aren’t, but are still being used by our governments, represent a huge breakdown of the system, since these decisions MUST be made with the trust and at the will of the populace.</p>
<h5>Build AIs that Provide Insight Into Results (when possible)</h5>
<p>Many types of AI models are completely opaque when it comes to how decisions are reached.  This doesn’t mean however that all of our AIs must be complete black-boxes.  It is true that  most of the common machine learning methods such as Deep-Neural-Networks (DNNs) are extremely difficult to analyze.  However, there are other types of models that are much more transparent when it comes to decision making.  Some model types will not be useable on all problems, but when the options exist, transparency should be a strong consideration.</p>
<p>There are also techniques that can be used to make even opaque models more transparent.  For example, a hybrid technique (<a href="../Posts/AI-That-Can-Explain-Why.html">AI That Can Explain Why</a> &amp; <a href="../Posts/An-Example-of-a-Hybrid-AI-Implementation.html">An Example of a Hybrid AI Implementation</a>) can be used to run opaque models iteratively.  This can allow the developer to log key details at specific points in the process, making the decisions much more transparent.  There are also techniques to manipulate the data after a decision is made, to gain insight into the reasons for the decision.</p>
<h5>Don’t Give the AI the Codes to the Nukes</h5>
<p>Computers should never be allowed to make automated decisions that cannot be reversed by a human if necessary. Decisions like when to attack a target, execute a criminal, vent radioactive waste, or ditch an aircraft are all decisions that require human verification since they cannot be undone if the model has an error or is faced with  a completely unforeseen set of conditions. There are no circumstances where machines should be making such decisions for us without the opportunity for human intervention, and it is up to us, the programmers, to make sure that we don’t give them that capability.</p>
<h5>Don’t Build it if it Can’t be Done Ethically</h5>
<p>If we are unable to come up with an algorithm that is free from bias, perhaps the situation is not appropriate for an automated decision making process.  Not every situation will warrant an AI solution, and it is very likely that there are decisions that should always be made by a human in totality.  For those situations, a decision support system may be a better solution.</p>
<h4>The Burden is Ours</h4>
<p>As the creators of automated decision making systems, we have the responsibility to make sure that the decisions they make do not violate our standards or ethics.  We cannot depend on our AIs to make fair and reasonable decisions unless we program them to do so, and programming them to avoid inherent biases requires an awareness and openness that has not always been present.  By taking the steps outlined here to be aware of the dangers and to mitigate it wherever possible, we have a chance of making decisions that we can all be proud of, and have confidence in.</p>

    <h3>An Example of a Hybrid AI Implementation</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2017-10-13 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I <a href="../Posts/AI-That-Can-Explain-Why.html">previously</a> wrote about a Hybrid AI system that combined logical and optimization methods of problem solving to identify the best solution to an employee shift assignment problem. This implementation was notable in that a hybrid approach was used so that the optimal solution could be found, but the system could still indicate to the users why a particular assignment was, or wasn’t, included in the results.</p>
<p>I recently published to <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/AIDemos">GitHub</a> a demo of a similar system. I use this demo in my presentation <a href="../Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html">Building AI Solutions that can Reason Why</a>. The code demonstrates the hybridization of multiple AI techniques by creating a solution that iteratively applies a combinatorial optimization engine. Different results are obtained by varying the methods of applying the constraints in that model. In the final (4th) demo  method, an iterative process is used to identify what the shortcomings of the final product are, and why they are necessary.</p>
<p>These demos use the <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/ConferenceScheduler">Conference Scheduler</a> AI project to build a valid schedule.</p>
<p>There are 4 examples, each of which reside in a separate test method:</p>
<h3>ScheduleWithNoRestrictions()</h3>
<p>The 1st method in <strong>BasicExamplesDemo.cs</strong> shows an unconstrained model where only the hardest of constraints are excluded. That is, the only features of the schedule that are considered by the scheduler are those that are absolute <strong>must-haves</strong>.  Since there are fewer hard constraints, it is relatively easy to satisfy all the requirements of this model.</p>
<h3>ScheduleWithHardConstraints()</h3>
<p>The 2nd method in <strong>BasicExamplesDemo.cs</strong> shows a fully constrained model where  all constraints are considered <strong>must-haves</strong>. That is, the only schedules that will be considered for our conference are those that meet <strong>all</strong> of the scheduling criteria. As you might imagine, this can be difficult to do, in this case resulting in <strong>No Feasible Solution</strong> being found. Because we use a combinatorial optimization model, the system gives us no clues as to  which of the constraints cause the infeasibility, or what to do that might allow it to find a solution.</p>
<h3>ScheduleWithTimePreferencesAsAnOptimization()</h3>
<p>The 3rd method in <strong>BasicExamplesDemo.cs</strong> shows the solution when the true <strong>must-haves</strong> are considered hard constraints but preferences are not. The AI attempts to optimize the solution by satisfying as many of the soft constraints (preferences) as possible. This results in an imperfect, but possibly best case schedule, but one where we have little insight as to what preferences were not satisfied, and almost no insight as to why.</p>
<h3>AddConstraintsDemo()</h3>
<p>The final demo, and the only method in <strong>AddConstraintsDemo.cs</strong>, builds on the 3rd demo, where the true <strong>must-haves</strong> are considered hard constraints but preferences are not. Here however, instead of attempting to optimize the soft constraints, the AI iteratively adds the preferences as hard constraints, one at a time, re-executing the solution after each to make sure the problem has not become infeasible. If the solution has become infeasible, that fact is recorded along with what was being attempted. Then that constraint is removed and the process continues with the remaining constraints. This <strong>Hybrid</strong> process still results in an imperfect, but best-case schedule. This time however, we not only know what preferences could not be satisfied, we have a good idea as to why.</p>
<h3>The Hybrid Process</h3>
<p>The process of iteratively executing the optimization, adding constraints one at a time, is show in the diagram below.  It is important to remember that the order in which these constraints are added here is critical since constraining the solution in one way may limit the feasibility of the solution for future constraints.  Great care must be taken in selecting the order that constraints are added in order to obtain the best possible solution.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Hybrid%20Conference%20Optimization%20Process_thumb.png" alt="Hybrid Conference Optimization Process" /></p>
<p>The steps are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure we can solve the problem without any of the soft constraints.  If the problem doesn’t have any feasible solutions at the start of the process, we are certainly not going to find any by adding constraints.</li>
<li>Add a constraint to the solution. Do so by selecting the next most important constraint in order.  In the case of our conference schedule, we are adding in speaker preferences for when they speak. These preferences are being added in the order that they were requested (first-come first-served).</li>
<li>Verify that there is still at least 1 feasible solution to the problem after the constraint is added.  If no feasible solutions can be found:
<ol>
<li>Remove the constraint.</li>
<li>Record the details of the constraint.</li>
<li>Record the current state of the model.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 &amp; 3 until all constraints have been tried.</li>
<li>Publish the solution
<ol>
<li>The resulting schedule</li>
<li>The constraints that could not be added.  This tells us what preferences could not be accommodated.</li>
<li>The state of the model at the time the failed constraints were tried.  This give us insight as to why the constraints could not be satisfied.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note</em>: The sample data in these demos is <strong>very</strong> loosely based on SoCalCodeCamp San Diego from the summer of 2017. While some of the presenters names and presentations come roughly from the publicly available schedule, pretty much everything else has been fictionalized to make for a compelling demo, including the appearances by some Microsoft rock stars, and the &quot;requests&quot; of the various presenters.</p>

    <h3>Building AI Solutions with Google OR-Tools</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2017-09-28 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>My presentation from the #NDCSydney conference has been published on <a href="https://youtu.be/zZAobExOMB0">YouTube</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We depend on Artificial Intelligences to solve many types of problems for us. Some of these problems have more than one possible solution. Handling those problems with more than one solution while building a modern AI system is something every developer will be asked to do over the course of his or her career. Figuring out the best way to utilize the capacity of a device or machine, finding the shortest path between two points, or determining the best way to schedule people or events are all problems where mathematical optimization techniques and tooling can be used to quickly and efficiently find solutions.</p>
<p>This session is a software developers introduction to using mathematical optimization in Artificial Intelligence. In it, we will explore some of the foundational techniques for solving these types of problems, and use the open-source Google OR-Tools to put them to work in our AI systems. Since this is a session for developers, we'll keep it in terms that work best for us. That is, we'll go heavy on the code and lighter on the math.</p>

    <h3>Scalable Decision Making</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2017-06-01 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I recently had a developer colleague return from an AI conference and tell me something along the lines of &quot;…all they really showed were algorithms, nothing that really learned.&quot; Unfortunately, there is this common misconception, even among people in the software community, that to have an AI, you need Machine Learning. Now don't get me wrong, Machine Learning is an amazing technique and it has been used to create many real breakthroughs in Software Engineering. But, to have AI you don't need Machine Learning, you simply need a system that makes decisions that otherwise would need to be made by humans. That is, you need a machine to act rationally. There are many ways to accomplish this goal. I have explored <a href="..//Search/ai.html">a few methods</a> in this forum in the past, and will explore more in the future. Today however, I want to discuss the real value proposition of AI. That is, the ability to make decisions at scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value in AI comes not from how the decisions are made, but from the ability to scale those decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see 4 types of scale as key in evaluating the value that Artificial Intelligences may bring to a problem. They are the <strong>solution space</strong>, the <strong>data requirements</strong>, the <strong>problem space</strong> and the <strong>volume</strong>. Let's explore each of these types of scale briefly.</p>
<h5>Solution Space</h5>
<p>The solution space consists of all of the possible answers to a question. It is the AIs job to evaluate the different options and determine the best decision to make under the circumstances. As the number of options increases, it becomes more and more important for the decisions to be made in an automated, scalable way. Artificial Intelligences can add real value when solving problems that have very large solution spaces. As an example, let's look at the scheduling of conference sessions. A very small conference with 3 sessions and 3 rooms during 1 timeslot is easy to schedule. Anyone can manually sort both the sessions and rooms by size (expected and actual) and assign the largest room to the session where the most people are expected to attend. 3 sessions and 3 rooms has only 6 possible answers, a very small solution space. If, on the other hand, our conference has 450 sessions spread out over 30 rooms and 15 timeslots, the number of possibilities grows astronomically. There are 450! (450 factorial) possible combinations of sessions, rooms and timeslots in that solution space, far too many for a person to evaluate even in a lifetime of trying. In fact, that solution space is so large that a brute-force algorithm that evaluates every possible combination for fitness, may never complete either. We need to depend on combinatorial optimization techniques and good heuristics to manage these types of decisions, which makes problems with a large solution space excellent candidates for Artificial Intelligence solutions.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Data Requirements</h5>
<p>The data requirements consist of all of the different data elements needed to make the optimal decision. Decisions that require only a small number of data elements can often be evaluated manually. However, when the number of data elements to be evaluated becomes unwieldy, a problem becomes a good candidate for an Artificial Intelligence. Consider the problem of comparing two hitters from the history of baseball. Was Mark McGwire a better hitter than Mickey Mantle? We might decide to base our decision on one or two key statistics. If so, we might say that McGwire was a better hitter than Mantle because his OPS is slightly better (.982 vs .977). If, however we want to build a model that takes many different variables into account, hopefully maximizing the likelihood of making the best determination, we may try to include many of the hundreds of different statistics that are tracked for baseball players. In this scenario, an automated process has a better chance of making an informed, rational decision.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Problem Space</h5>
<p>The problem space defines how general the decision being made can be. The more generalized an AI, the more likely it is to be applicable to any given situation, the more value it is likely to have. Building on our previous example, consider these three problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a particular baseball hitter better than another baseball hitter?</li>
<li>Is a particular baseball player better than another baseball player (hitter or pitcher)?</li>
<li>Is a particular baseball player a better athlete than a particular soccer player?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is relatively easy to compare apples to apples. I can compare one hitter to another fairly easily by simply comparing known statistics after adjusting for any inconsistencies (such as what era or league they played in). The closer the comparison and the more statistics they have in common, the more likely I am to be able to build a model that is highly predictive of the optimum answer and thus make the best decisions. Once I start comparing apples to oranges, or even cucumbers, the waters become much more muddied. How do I build a model that can make decisions when I don't have direct ways to compare the options?</p>
<p>AIs today are still limited to fairly small problem spaces, and as such, they are limited in scope and value. Many breakthroughs are being made however that allow us to make more and more generalizable decisions. For example, many of the AI &quot;personal assistants&quot; such as Cortana and Siri use a combination of different AIs depending on the problem. This makes them something of an AI of AIs and expands their capabilities, and thus their value, considerably.</p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Volume</h5>
<p>The volume of a problem describes the way we usually think of scale in software engineering problems. That is, it is the number of times the program is used to reach a decision over a given timeframe. Even a very simple problem with small solution and problem spaces, and very simple data needs, can benefit from automation if the decision has to be made enough times in a rapid succession. Let's use a round-robin load balancer on a farm of 3 servers as an example. Round Robin is a simple heuristic for load balancing that attempts to distribute the load among the servers by deciding to send the traffic to each machine in order. The only data needed for this decision is the knowledge of what machine was selected during the last execution. There are only 3 possible answers and the problem space is very small and well understood. A person could easily make each decision without difficulty as long as the volume remains low. As soon as the number of requests starts increasing however, a person would find themselves quickly overwhelmed. Even when the other factors are small in scale, high-volume decisions make very good candidates for AI solutions.</p>
<p>These 4 factors describing the scale of a problem are important to consider when attempting to determine if an automated Artificial Intelligence solution is a good candidate to be a part of a solution. Once it has been decided that an AI is appropriate for a problem, we can then look at the options for implementing the solution. Machine Learning is one possible candidate for many problems, but certainly not all. Much more on that in future articles.</p>
<p>Do you agree that the value in AI comes not from how the decisions are made, but from the ability to scale those decisions? Did I miss any scale factors that should be considered when determining if an AI solution might be appropriate?

    <h3>A Requirement for AI Systems</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2017-05-24 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I've written and spoken before about the importance of using the Strategy Pattern to create maintainable and testable systems. Strategies are even more important, almost to the level of necessity, when building AI systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Strategy Pattern is to algorithms what the Repository Pattern is to data stores, a useful and well-known abstraction for loose-coupling.
— Barry Stahl (@bsstahl) <a href="https://twitter.com/bsstahl/status/817398427529003008">January 6, 2017</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Strategy Pattern is an abstraction tool used to maintain loose-coupling between an application and the algorithm(s) that it uses to do its job. Since the algorithms used in AI systems have many different ways they could be implemented, it is important to abstract the implementation from the system that uses it. I tend to work with systems that use combinatorial optimization methods to solve their problems, but there are many ways for AIs to make decisions. Machine Learning is one of the hottest methods right now but AI systems can also depend on tried-and-true object-oriented logic. The ability to swap algorithms without changing the underlying system allows us the flexibility to try multiple methods before settling on a specific implementation, or even to switch-out implementations as scenarios or situations change.</p>
<p>When I give <a href="../Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html">conference talks</a> on building AI Systems using optimization methods, I always encourage the attendees to create a &quot;naïve&quot; solution first, before spending a lot of effort to build complicated logic. This allows the developer to understand the problem better than he or she did before doing any implementation. Creating this initial solution has another advantage though, it allows us to define the Strategy interface, giving us a better picture of what our application truly needs. Then, when we set-out to build a production-worthy engine, we do so with the knowledge of exactly what we need to produce.</p>
<p>There is also another component of many AIs that can benefit from the use of the Strategy pattern, and that is the determination of user intent. Many implementations of AI will include a user interaction, perhaps through a text-based interface as in a chatbot or a voice interface such as a personal assistant. Each cloud provider has their own set of services designed to determine the intent of the user based on the text or voice input. Each of these implementations has its own strengths and weaknesses. It is beneficial to be able to swap those mechanisms out at will, along with the ability to implement a &quot;naïve&quot; user intent solution during development, and the ability to mock user intent for testing. The strategy pattern is the right tool for this job as well.</p>
<p>As more and more of our applications depend heavily on algorithms, we will need to make a concerted effort to abstract those algorithms away from our applications to maintain loose-coupling and all of the benefits that loose-coupling provides. This is why I consider the Strategy Pattern to be a necessity when developing Artificial Intelligence solutions.</p>

    <h3>Testing the Untestable with Microsoft Fakes</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2017-03-20 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>It is fairly easy these days to test code in isolation if its dependencies are abstracted by a reusable interface. But what do we do if the dependency cannot easily be referenced via such an interface?  Enter <strong>Shims</strong>, from the <strong>Microsoft Fakes Framework</strong>(formerly Moles).  Shims allow us to isolate our testing from any dependent methods, including methods in assemblies we do not control, even if those methods are not exposed through a reusable interface. To see how easy it is, follow along with me through this example.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/VS2017Launch">sample code on GitHub</a>, we are building a repository for an application that currently gets its data from a file exported from a system that tracks scheduled meetings.  It is very likely that the system will, in the future, expose a more modern interface for that data so we have isolated the data storage using a simple Repository interface that has one method.  This method, called <strong>GetMeetings</strong> returns a collection of Meeting entities that start during the specified date range.  The method will return an empty collection if no data is found matching the specified criteria, and could throw either of 2 custom errors, a <strong>PermissionsException</strong>when the user does not have the proper permissions to access the information, and a <strong>DataUnavailableException</strong> for when the data source is unavailable for any other reason, such as a network outage or if the data file cannot be located.</p>
<p>It is important to point out why a custom exception should be thrown when the data file is not found, rather than allowing the <strong>FileNotFoundException</strong> to bubble-up.  If we allow the implementation-specific exception to bubble, we have exposed an implementation detail to the caller. That is, the calling code is now aware of the fact that this is a file system implementation.  If code is written in a client that traps for <strong>FileNotFoundException</strong>, then the repository implementation is swapped-out for a SQL server implementation, the client code will have to change to handle the new types of errors that could be thrown by that implementation.  This violates the Dependency Inversion principle, the “D” from the <strong>SOLID</strong> principles.  By exposing only a custom exception, we are hiding those implementation details from the caller.</p>
<p>Downstream clients can easily test code that uses this repository without having to actually access the repository implementation because we have exposed the <strong>IMeetingSourceRepository</strong> interface. However, it is a bit more difficult to actually test the repository implementation itself.  We have a few options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create data files that hold known data samples and load those files during unit testing.</li>
<li>Create a wrapper around the System.IO namespace that exposes an interface, such as in the <a href="https://github.com/System-IO-Abstractions/System.IO.Abstractions">System.IO.Abstractions</a> project.</li>
<li>Don’t test any code that requires reaching-out to the file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <a href="..//Posts/Remove-Any-Code-Your-Users-Dont-Care-About.html">I am of the opinion that 100% code coverage is both reasonable, and desirable</a> (although not a measurable goal), I will summarily dispose of option 3 for the purpose of this analysis. I have used option 2 many times in my life, and while employing wrapper code is a valid and reasonable solution, it adds additional code to my production deployments that is very limited in terms of what it adds to the loose-coupling of my solution since I already am loosely-coupled to this implementation via the <strong>IMeetingSourceRepository</strong> interface.</p>
<p>Even though it is far from a perfect solution (many would consider them more integration tests than unit tests), I initially selected option 1 for this implementation. That is, I created data files and deployed them along with my tests.  You can see the test files I created in the <strong>Data</strong> folder of the <strong>MeetingSystem.Data.FileSystem.Test</strong> project.  These files are deployed alongside my tests using the <strong>DeploymentItem</strong> directive that decorates the <strong>Repository_GetMeetings_Should</strong> class of the test project.  Using this method, I was able to create tests that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that the correct # of meetings are returned from a file</li>
<li>Verify that meetings are properly filtered by the <strong>StartDateTime</strong> of the meeting</li>
<li>Validate the data elements returned from the file</li>
<li>Validate that the proper custom exception is thrown if a <strong>FileNotFoundException</strong> is thrown by the underlying code</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have verified nearly everything we need to test in our implementation.  We’ve verified that the data is returned properly, and that one of our custom exceptions is being returned. But what about the <strong>PermissionsException</strong>?  We were able to simulate a <strong>FileNotFoundException</strong> in our tests by just using a bad filename, but how do we test for a permissions problem?  The <strong>ReadAllText</strong> method of the <strong>File</strong> object from <strong>System.IO</strong> will throw a <strong>System.Security.SecurityException</strong> if the file cannot be read due to a permissions problem.  We need to trap this exception and throw our own exception, but how can we validate that we have successfully done so and that the functionality remains intact through future refactoring?  How can we simulate a permissions exception on a file that we have enough permission on to deploy to a test folder? Enter <strong>Shims</strong> from the <strong>Microsoft Fakes Framework</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of having our tests actually reach-out to the file system and actually try to load a file, we can intercept calls to the <strong>System.IO.File.ReadAllText</strong> method and have those calls execute some delegate code instead. This code, which we write in our test methods, can be specific to each test and exist only within the context of the test. As a result, we are not deploying any additional code to production, while still thoroughly validating our code.  In fact, using this methodology, I could re-implement my previous tests, including my test data in the tests themselves, making these tests better unit tests.  I could then reserve tests that actually reach out to files for integration test libraries that are run less frequently, and perhaps even behind the scenes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you wish to follow-along with these instructions, you can grab the code from the <strong>DemoStart</strong> branch of the <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/VS2017Launch">GitHub repo</a>, rather than the <strong>Master</strong> branch where this is already done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use <strong>Shims</strong>, we first have to create a Fakes Assembly.  This is done by right-clicking on the <strong>System</strong> reference in the test project from Visual Studio 2017, and selecting “<strong>Add Fakes Assembly</strong>” (full framework only – not yet available for .NET Core assemblies). Be sure to do this in the test project since we don’t want to actually deploy the Fakes assembly in our production code.  Using the add fakes assembly menu item does 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adds a reference to Microsoft.QualityTools.Testing.Fakes assembly</li>
<li>Creates 2 .fakes XML files in the Fakes folder within the test project. These items are built into corresponding fakes dll files that are deployed with the test project and used to provide stub and shim objects that mimic the objects in the selected assemblies.  These fake objects reside in the same namespace as their “real” counterparts, except with “Fakes” on the end. Thus, our fake <strong>File</strong> object will reside in the <strong>System.IO.Fakes</strong> namespace.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="..//Images/Fakes.png" alt="Microsoft Fakes" /></p>
<p>The next step in using shims is to create a <strong>ShimsContext</strong> within a <strong>Using</strong> statement. Any method calls that execute within this context can be intercepted and replaced by our delegates.  For example, a test that replaces the call to <strong>ReadAllText</strong> with a method that returns a single line of constant data can be seen below.</p>
<p>Methods on shim objects are referenced through properties of the fake object.  These properties are of type <strong>FakesDelegate.Func</strong> and match the signature of the method being shimmed.  The return data type is also appended to the property name so that each item’s signature can be represented with a different property name.  In this case, the <strong>ReadAllText</strong> method of the <strong>File</strong> object is represented in the <strong>System.IO.Fakes.File</strong> object as a property called <strong>ReadAllTextString</strong>, of type <strong>FakesDelegate.Func&lt;string, string&gt;</strong>, since the method takes a string parameter (the path of the file), and returns a string (the text contents of the file).  If we assign a method delegate to this property, that method will be executed in place of the call to <strong>System.IO.File.ReadAllText</strong> whenever <strong>ReadAllText</strong> is called within the <strong>ShimContext</strong>.</p>
<p>In the gist shown above, the variable <strong><em>p</em></strong> represents the input parameter and will hold the path specified in the test (in this case “April2017.abc”).  The return value for our delegate method comes from the constant string <strong><em>dataFile</em></strong>.  We can put anything we want here.  We can replace the delegate with a call to an anonymous method, or with a call to an existing method.  We can return a value gleaned from an external source, or, as is needed for our permissions test, throw an exception.</p>
<p>For the purposes of our test to verify that we throw a PermissionsException when a SecurityException is thrown, we can replace the value of the ReadAllTextString property with our delegate which throws the exception we need to test for,  as seen here:</p>
<pre><code>System.IO.Fakes.ShimFile.ReadAllTextString =       
     p =&gt; throw new System.Security.SecurityException(&quot;Test Exception&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we can verify in our test that our custom exception is thrown.  The full working example can be seen by grabbing the <strong>Master</strong> branch of the <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/VS2017Launch">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>What can you test with these Shim objects that you were unable to test before?  Tell me about it <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>Demo Code for Testing in Visual Studio 2017</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2017-03-16 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: event" class="small" href="../Search/event.html">event</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>The demo code for my presentation on Testing in Visual Studio 2017 at the VS2017 Launch event can be found on <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/VS2017Launch">GitHub</a>.  There are 2 branches to this repository, the <strong>Main</strong> branch which holds the completed demo, and the <strong>DemoStart</strong> branch which holds the starting point of the demonstration in case you would like to implement the sample yourself.</p>
<p>The demo shows how Microsoft Fakes (formerly Moles) can be used to create tests against code that does not implement a reusable interface. This can be done  without having to resort to integration style tests or writing extra wrapper code just to implement an interface.  During my launch presentation, I also use this code to demonstrate the use of Intellitest (formerly Pex) to generate exploratory tests.</p>

    <h3>Testing a .NET Core Library in VS2015</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2017-01-09 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I really enjoy working with .NET Core.  I like the fact that my code is portable to many platforms and that the footprint is so much smaller than with traditional .NET applications.  Unfortunately, the tooling has not quite reached the level that we expect from a Microsoft finished product (which it isn’t – yet). As a result, there are some additional actions we need to take when setting up our solutions in Visual Studio 2015 to allow us to unit test our code properly.  The following are the steps that I currently take to setup and test a .NET Core library using XUnit and Moq.  I know that a number of these steps will be done for us, or at least made much easier, by the tooling in the coming months, either by Visual Studio 2017, or by enhancements to the Visual Studio 2015 environments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the library to be tested in Visual Studio 2015
<ol>
<li>File &gt; New Project &gt; .Net Core &gt; Class Library</li>
<li>Notice that this project is created in a solution folder called ‘src’</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create a solution folder named ‘test’ to hold our test projects
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the Solution &gt; Add &gt; New Solution Folder</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add a new console application to the test folder as our test project
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the ‘test’ folder &gt; Add &gt; New Project &gt; .Net Core &gt; Console Application</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add a reference to the library being tested in the test project
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the test project &gt; Add &gt; Reference &gt; Select the library to be tested</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Install packages needed for unit testing from NuGet to the test project
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the test project &gt; Manage NuGet Packages &gt; Browse</li>
<li>Install ‘xunit’ as our unit test runner
<ol>
<li>The current version for .Net Core is ‘2.2.0-beta4-build3444’</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Install ‘dotnet-test-xunit’ to integrate xunit with the Visual Studio test tools
<ol>
<li>The current version for .Net Core is ‘2.2.0-preview2-build1029’</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Install ‘Moq’ as our mocking library
<ol>
<li>The current version for .Net Core is ‘4.6.38-alpha’</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Edit the project.json of the test library
<ol>
<li>Change the “EmitEntryPoint” option to false</li>
<li>Add “testrunner” : “xunit” node</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other optional steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the ‘Microsoft.CodeCoverage’ package from NuGet to enable the code coverage tooling</li>
<li>Install the ‘Microsoft.Extension.DependencyInjection’ package from NuGet to enable DI</li>
<li>Install the ‘TestHelperExtensions’ package from NuGet to add extensions that assist with writing good unit tests</li>
<li>Add any additional runtimes that might be needed. Some options are:
<ul>
<li>win10-x86</li>
<li>win10-x64</li>
<li>win7-x86</li>
<li>win7-x64</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set ‘Run tests after build’ in Visual Studio so tests run automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>There will likely be better ways to do many of these things shortly, but if you know a better way now, please let me know <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>A.I. That Can Explain "Why"</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2016-12-15 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>One of my favorite authors among Software Architects, IBM Fellow Grady Booch, made this reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a>, IBM’s program built to play the board game <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29">Go</a></em>, in April of 2016:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...there are things neural networks can't easily do and likely never will. AlphaGo can't reason about why it made a particular move.&quot; – Grady Booch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grady went on to refer to the concept of “Hybrid A.I.” as a means of developing systems that can make complex decisions requiring the processing of huge datasets, while still being able to explain the rationale behind those decisions.</p>
<p>While not exactly the type of system Grady was describing, it reminded me of a solution I was involved with creating that ultimately became a hybrid of an iterative, imperative system and a combinatorial optimization engine.  The resulting solution was able to both determine the optimum solution for a problem with significant data requirements, while still being able to provide information to support the decision, both to prove it was correct, and to help the users learn how to best use it.</p>
<p>The problem looked something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Ideal%20Solution%20Space_thumb.png" alt="Ideal Solution Space" /></p>
<p>There are many possible ways to allocate work assignments among employees.  Some of those allocations would not be legal, perhaps because the employee is not qualified for that assignment, or because of time limits on how much he or she can work.  Other options may be legal, but are not ideal.  The assignment may be sub-optimal for the employee who may have a schedule conflict or other preference against that particular assignment, or for the company which may not be able to easily fill the assignment with anyone else.</p>
<p>The complexity in this problem comes from the fact that this diagram is different for each employee to be assigned.  Each employee has their own set of preferences and legalities, and the preferences of the company are probably different for each employee.  It is likely that many employees will not be able to get an assignment that falls into the “Ideal Solution” area of the drawing.  If there were just a few employees and a supervisor was making these decisions, that person would have to explain his or her rationale to the employees who did not get the assignments they wanted, or to the bosses if company requirements could not be met. If an optimization solution made the decisions purely on the basis of a mathematical model, we could be guaranteed the best solution based on our criteria, but would have no way to explain how one person got an assignment that another wanted, or why company preferences were ignored in any individual case.</p>
<p>The resulting hybrid approach started by eliminating illegal options, and then looking at the most important detail and assigning the best fit for that detail to the solution set.  That is, if the most important feature to the model was the wishes of the most senior employee, that employee’s request would be added to the solution. The optimization engine would then be run to be sure that a feasible solution was still available.  As long as an answer could still be found that didn’t violate any of the hard constraints, the selection was fixed in the solution and the next employee’s wishes addressed.  If a feasible solution could not be found using the selected option, that selection would be recorded along with the result of the optimization and the state of the model at the time of processing.  This allows the reasoning behind each decision to be exposed to the users.</p>
<p>A very simplified diagram of the process is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Hybrid%20Decision%20Making_thumb.png" alt="Hybrid Decision Making" /></p>
<p>Each time the green diamond testing “Is the solution still feasible?” is hit, the optimization model is run to verify that a solution can be found.  It is this hybrid process, the iterative execution of a combinatorial solution engine, that gives this tool its ability to both answer the question of <em>how to do things</em>, while also being able to answer the question of <em>why it needs to be done this way</em>.</p>
<p>Like Grady, I expect we will see many more examples of these types of hybrids in the very near future.</p>

    <h3>Is a Type an Implementation of an Interface?</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2016-11-17 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>One of the techniques I recommend highly in my <a href="../Posts/Simplify-Your-API.html">Simplify Your API</a> talk is the use of extension methods to hide the complexity of lower-level API functionality.  A good example of a place to use this methodology came-up last night in a great Reflection talk by Jeremy Clark (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremybytes">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/">Blog</a>) at the <a href="http://www.nwvdnug.org">NorthWest Valley .NET User Group</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Jeremy_2.jpg" alt="Jeremy" /></p>
<p>Jeremy was demonstrating a method that would spin-through an assembly and load all classes within that assembly that implemented a particular interface.  The syntax to do the checks on each type were just a bit more obtuse than Jeremy would have liked them to be.  As we left that talk, I only half-jokingly told Jeremy that I was going to write him an extension method to make that activity simpler.  Being a man of my word, I present the code below to do just that.</p>

    <h3>Code Coverage Teaches and Protects</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2016-10-14 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I often hail code coverage as a great tool to help improve your code base.  Today, my use of Code Coverage taught me something about the new .NET Core tooling, and helped protect me from having to support useless code for the lifespan of my project.</p>
<p>In the code below, I used a common dependency injection pattern. That is, an IServiceProvider object holding my dependencies is passed-in to my object and stored as a member variable.  When a dependency is needed, I retrieve that dependency from the service provider, and then take action on it.  Since there is no guarantee that the dependency I need will have been placed in the container, I use some common guard logic to protect my code.</p>
<pre><code>templates = _serviceProvider.GetService&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Template&gt;&gt;();
if ((templates==null) || (!templates.Any(s =&gt; s.TemplateType==ContactPage)))
     throw new TemplateNotFoundException(TemplateType.ContactPage, string.Empty);
</code></pre>
<p>In this code, I first test that I was able to retrieve a collection of Template objects from the service provider, then verify that the type of Template I need is present in the collection.  If either is not the case, an exception is thrown.</p>
<p>I had two tests that covered this section of code, one where the collection was not added to the service provider, the other where an empty collection was added.  Both tests passed, however, it wasn't until I looked at the results of the Code Coverage that I realized that the 1st test wasn't doing what I thought it was doing.  It turns out that there is actually no way to get a null collection object out of the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceProvider object I am using for my .NET Core apps. That provider simply returns an empty collection if there isn't one in the container.  Thus, my check for null was never matched and that branch of code was never executed.</p>
<p>Based on this new knowledge of the behavior of the IServiceProvider, I had a few options.  I could:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rewrite my test to check for an empty collection.  This option seems redundant to me since my check to see if the container holds the template I need is really what I care about.</li>
<li>Leave the code as-is just in case the behavior of the container changes, accepting that I have what is currently unnecessary and untestable code in my application.  I considered this option but it seems to me that a better defense against the unlikely event of a breaking change in the IServiceProvider implementation is described below in option 3.</li>
<li>Create a new test that verifies the behavior on the ServiceProvider that an empty collection is returned if no collection is supplied to the container.  I am not a big fan of this option since it requires me to test OPC (other people's code), and because the risk of this type of breaking change is, in my opinion, extremely low.</li>
<li>Remove the guard code that tests for null and the test that supports it.  Since the code is completely unnecessary, the test itself is redundant because it is, essentially identical to the test verifying that the template I need is in the collection.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure you've guessed by now that I selected option 4.  I removed the guard code and the test from my solution.  In doing so, I removed dead code that served no purpose, but would have to be supported through the life of the project.<br />
   <br />
For those who might be thinking something similar to, &quot;It's nice that the coverage tooling helped you learn about your code, but using Code Coverage as a metric is actually a bad idea so I won't use Code Coverage at all&quot;, I'd like to remind you that any tool, such as a hammer or a car, can be abused. That doesn't mean we don't continue to use them, we just make certain that we use them properly.  Code Coverage is a horrible way to measure a development team or effort, but it is an outstanding tool and should be used by the development team whenever possible to discover things about the code base.</p>

    <h3>A Software Developer's View of Dynamic Programming</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2016-07-01 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Dynamic Programming (DP) is a mathematical tool that can be used to efficiently solve certain types of problems and is a must-have in any software developer's toolbox. A lot has been written about this process from a mathematician's perspective but there are very few resources out there to help software developers who want to implement this technique in code. In this article and the companion conference talk &quot;<a href="../Posts/Dynamic-Optimization-Presentation.html">Dynamic Optimization - One Algorithm All Programmers Should Know</a>&quot;, I attempt to demystify this simple tool so that developer's can implement it for their customers.</p>
<h4>What is Combinatorial Optimization?</h4>
<p>Mathematical or Combinatorial Optimization is the process of finding the best available solution to a problem by minimizing or eliminating undesirable factors and maximizing desirable ones.  For example, we might want to find the best path through a graph that represents the roads and intersections of our city.  In this case, we might want to minimize the distance travelled, or the estimated amount of time it will take to travel that distance.  Other examples of optimization problems include determining the best utilization of a machine or device, optimal assignment of scarce resources, and a spell-checker determining the most likely word being misspelled.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that we do not conflate combinatorial optimization with code optimization.  It is certainly important to have efficient code when running an optimization algorithm, however there are very different techniques for optimizing code than for optimizing the solution to a problem. Code optimization has to do with the efficiency of the implementation whereas combinatorial optimization deals with the efficiency of the algorithm itself.  Efficiency in both areas will be critical for solving problems in large domains.</p>
<h4>What is Dynamic Programming?</h4>
<p>Ultimately, DP is just a process, a methodology for solving optimization problems that can be defined recursively <sub>1</sub>.  It is really about a way of attacking a problem that, if it were addressed naïvely, might not produce the best possible answer, or might not even converge to a solution in an acceptable amount of time.  Dynamic Programming provides a logical approach to these types of problems through a 2-step process that has the effect of breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems and solving each sub-problem only once, caching the results for later use <sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The steps in the process are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill out the cache by determining the value of each sub-problem, building each answer based on the value of the previous answers</li>
<li>Use the values in the cache to answer questions about the problem</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we fill-out the entire cache for each problem <sub>3</sub>, we can be 100% certain that we know what the best possible answers to the questions are because we have explored all possibilities.</p>
<h4>Dynamic Programming in Action</h4>
<p>Let's look at one of the canonical types of problems that can be solved using Dynamic Programming, the knapsack problem.  A knapsack problem occurs in any situation where you have a limited capacity that can be consumed by a number of different possible options.  We need to look for the best fit and optimize for the maximum based on the definition of value in our problem.  This class of problem gets its name from the story of the archeologist in the collapsing ruin.  She has a knapsack that can hold a known weight without tearing and she needs to use it to rescue artifacts from the ruin before it collapses entirely.   She wants to maximize the value of artifacts she can save, without exceeding the capacity of her knapsack, because it would then tear and she wouldn't be able to carry anything.</p>
<p>We can solve this type of problem using Dynamic Programming by filling-out a table that holds possible capacities, from 0 to the capacity of our known knapsack, and each of the possible items to use to fill that space, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Knapsack.png" alt="A Table for Solving this Knapsack Problem" /></p>
<p>In this example, there are 3 items with weights of 4, 5 and 2.  These items have values of 5, 6 and 3 respectively and can be placed in a knapsack with capacity of 9. The leftmost column of the table represents the capacities of knapsacks from 0, up to and including the capacity of our knapsack.  The next column represents the best value we would get in the knapsack if we had the option of putting 0 items in our knapsack. The next, the best value if we had the option of taking the 1st item, the next column, the option to take the 2nd item on top of any previous items, and so forth until we complete the table.  As you can see, the most value we can get in our knapsack with the option of picking from these 3 items is 11, as found in the last row of the last column. That is, the cell that represents a knapsack with our known capacity, with the option to chose from all of the items.</p>
<p>To calculate each of these cells, we build on the values calculated earlier in the process.  For the 1st column, it is easy. If we can chose no items, the value of the items in our knapsack is always 0. The rest of the cells are calculated by determining the greater of the following 2 values:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value if we didn't take the current item, which is always the value of the same capacity knapsack from the previous column</li>
<li>The value if we took the current item, which is the value of the current item, added to the value of the knapsack from the previous column if the weight of the current item were removed</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for the cell in the column labeled &quot;1&quot; with a knapsack capacity of 6, we take the greater of:</p>
<ul>
<li>0, since we wouldn't have any items in  the knapsack if we chose not to take the item</li>
<li>5, the value of the current item, added to the value of the other items in the knapsack, which was previously empty</li>
</ul>
<p>For the cell in column &quot;2&quot; with a knapsack capacity of 9, we take the greater of:</p>
<ul>
<li>5, which is the value of the knapsack with capacity 9 from column &quot;1&quot; indicating that we didn't take the 2nd item</li>
<li>11, which is the value of the current item added to the best value of the knapsack with capacity 4 (subtract the weight of our current item from the capacity of the current knapsack) with the option of taking only the previous items.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each cell in the table can be filled out by doing these simple calculations, 1 addition and 1 comparison, using the values previously calculated as shown in the annotated table below.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Knapsack-CalculateValue.png" alt="Filling-out the Table to Solve the Knapsack Problem" /></p>
<p>So we've filled out the table and know, from the cell in the bottom right that the maximum value we can get from this knapsack with these items is 11. Great, but that only answers the question of maximum value, it doesn't tell us which items are chosen to achieve this value.  To determine that, we need to work backward from the known best value.</p>
<p>Starting at the known best value in the bottom-right cell, we can look one cell to the left to see that the value there is the same.  Since we know that taking an item would increase the value of the knapsack, we can know that we must not have chosen to take the item in the last column.  We can then repeat the process from there.  From the bottom cell in the column labeled &quot;2&quot;, we can look left and see that the value in the previous column did change, so we know we need to take the item in column &quot;2&quot; to get our maximum value.  Since we know that item 2 had a weight of 5, we can subtract that from the capacity of our knapsack, and continue the process from that point, knowing that we now only have 4 more units of capacity to work with.  Comparing the item in the column labeled &quot;1&quot; and a knapsack capacity of 4 with the value of the equivalent knapsack in column &quot;0&quot;, we can see that we need to include item 1 in our knapsack to get the optimum result.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Knapsack-DetermineResults.png" alt="Calculating the Results of the Knapsack Problem" /></p>
<h4>What did we actually do here?</h4>
<p>There is no magic here. All we did was take a problem that we could describe in a recursive way, and implement a process that used easy calculations that built upon the results of previous calculations, to fill-out a data cache that allowed us to answer the two primary questions of this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the maximum value of the knapsack with capacity 9 and the option to take the 3 previously described items up to the capacity of the knapsack?</li>
<li>Which items of the 3 do we need to take to achieve the maximum value described in question</li>
</ol>
<p>You can probably see that if both axes of this table, the capacity of the knapsack, and the number of items we can chose from, are extremely large, we may run into memory or processing-time constraints when implementing this solutions.  As a result, this may not be the best methodology for solving problems where both the capacity of the knapsack and the number of items is extremely high.  However, if either is a reasonable number, Dynamic Programming can produce a result that is guaranteed to be the optimum solution, in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

    <h3>TDD Helps Validate Your Tests</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2016-03-05 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>One of the reasons to use TDD over test-later approaches is that you get a better validation of your tests.</p>
<p>When the first thing you do with a test or series of tests is to run them against code that does nothing but throw a <em>NotImplementedException</em>, you know exactly what to expect. That is, all tests should fail because the code under test threw a <em>NotImplementedException</em>. After that, you can take iterative steps to implement the code. Along the way, you should always see your tests fail in appropriate ways.  Eventually, all of your tests should pass when the code is complete.</p>
<p>If tests start passing before they should, continue to fail when they shouldn’t, or fail for reasons that are different than what you’d expect at that point in the development process, you have a good indication that the test may not be doing what you want it to be doing.  This additional information about the tests can be very helpful in making sure your unit tests are properly testing your code.</p>
<p>Think about what happens when you add tests after the code has already been written.  Suppose you write a test for existing code, and it passes.  What do you really know about the test?  Is it working because it is adequately exercising your code? Did you forget to do an assert? Is it even testing the  proper bit of code? Code coverage tools can help with some of this but they can only help if the code under test is not already touched by other tests.  Stepping through the code in debug mode is another possibility, a third option is to comment out the code as if you were starting from scratch, effectively doing a TDD process without any of the other <a href="..//Pages/Unit-Testing-and-TDD-FAQ.html">benefits of TDD</a>.</p>
<p>What about when you write a test for previously written code, and the test fails?  At this point, there are 2 possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>The code-under-test is broken</li>
<li>The test is broken</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have 2 variables in the equation, the code and the test, when you could have had only 1.  To eliminate 1 of the variables, you have to again perform the TDD process without most of its benefits by commenting out the code and starting from ground zero.</p>
<p>Following a good TDD process is the best way to be confident that any test failures indicate problems in the code being tested, instead of the tests themselves.</p>

    <h3>Test-Driven Bug Fixes</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2016-02-27 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I had an experience this past week that reminded me of both the importance of continuing the Test Driven Development process beyond the initial development phases of a application's life-cycle, and that not all developers have yet fully grasped the concepts behind Test Driven Development.</p>
<p>One of the development teams I work with had a bug come-up in a bit of complex logic that I designed. I was asked to pair-up with one of the developers to help figure out the bug since he had already spent several hours looking at it. When I asked him to show me the tests that were failing, there weren't any. The bug was for a situation that we hadn't anticipated during initial development (a common occurrence) and he had not yet setup any tests that exposed the bug.</p>
<p>We immediately set out to rectify the situation by creating tests that failed as a result of the bug. Once these tests were created, it was a fairly simple process to use those tests as a debug platform to step through the code, find the problem and correct the bug. As is sometimes the case, fixing that bug caused another test to fail, a situation that was easily remedied since we knew about it due to the failing test.</p>
<p>After the code was complete and checked-in for build, the developer I was working with remarked on how he now &quot;got it&quot;. He had heard the words before, &quot;…write a test to expose the bug, then fix the bug.&quot; but they were empty words until he actually experienced using a test to do the debugging, and then saw existing tests prevent a regression failure in other code due to our bug fix. It is an experience all TDD practitioners have at some point and it is easy to forget that others may not yet have grokked the concepts behind the process.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, that very night, I got a ping from my friend Jeremy Clark (<a href="https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremybytes">twitter</a>) asking for comments on his latest <a href="https://youtu.be/l4xhTq4qmC0">YouTube video on TDD</a>. After watching it, I really couldn't offer any constructive criticism for him because there was absolutely nothing to criticize. As an introduction to the basics of TDD, I don't think it could have been done any better. If you are just getting started with TDD, or want to get started with TDD, or want a refresher on the basics of TDD, you need to watch this video.</p>
<p>Jeremy has indicated he will be doing more in this series in the future, delving deeper into the topic of TDD. Perhaps he will include an example of fixing a bug in existing code in a future video.</p>

    <h3>Not Following API Guidelines Has Impact</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2016-01-25 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Good API design requires the developer to return responses that provide useful and understandable information to the consumers of the API.  To effectively communicate with the consumers, these responses must utilize standards that are known to the developers who will be using them.  For .NET APIs, these standards include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing <em>IDisposable</em> on all objects that need disposal.</li>
<li>Throwing a <em>NotImplementedException</em> if a method is on the interface and is expected to be available in the future, but is not yet available for any reason.</li>
<li>Throwing an <em>ArgumentException</em> or <em>ArgumentNullException</em> as appropriate to indicate that bad input has been supplied to a method.</li>
<li>Throwing an <em>InvalidOperationException</em> if the use of a method is inappropriate or otherwise unavailable in the current context.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One thing that should absolutely not be done is returning a NULL from a method call unless the NULL is a valid result of the method, based on the provided input.</strong></p>
<p>I have spent the last few weeks working with a new vendor API.  In general, the implementation of their API has been good, but it is clear that .NET is not their primary framework.  This API does 2 things that have made it more difficult than necessary for me to work with the product:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disposable objects don’t implement <em>IDisposable</em>. As a result, I cannot simply wrap these objects in a <em>Using</em> statement to handle disposal when they go out of scope.</li>
<li>Several mathematical operators were overloaded, but some of them were implemented simply by returning a <em>NULL</em>. As a result:
<ol>
<li>I had to decompile their API assembly to determine if I was doing something wrong.</li>
<li>I am still unable to tell if this is a permanent thing or if the feature will be implemented in a future release.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please follow all API guidelines for the language or framework you are targeting whenever it is reasonable and possible to do so.</p>

    <h3>No More Collection Objects</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-10-27 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I don't create collection objects anymore.</p>
<p>I know, I know. I was they guy always preaching that every entity that was being collected had to have its own collection object. It was the right thing at the time; if you needed to take an action on an enumeration or list of objects, those actions needed to be done within a strongly-typed collection object to maintain encapsulation. Even if all that was happening was that an inherited <em>List&lt;T&gt;</em> function was being called, that functionality needed to be called on the <em>TCollection</em> object because, if it wasn't, it was likely that the next time logic needed to be performed on the collection, there wouldn't be a place to put it. Collection logic would end up being spread-out around your code rather than encapsulated in the collection. It was also possible that the implementation might change and need to be updated everywhere, instead of in one place.</p>
<p>Today however, that has all changed. Extension methods now allow us, at any time, to add functionality to <em>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</em>, <em>IList&lt;T&gt;</em>, <em>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</em> or any other interface or class. We can attach our list or enumeration based actions directly to the list or enumeration class, and do so at any time, since the methods appear the same to the developer as methods directly on the collection type. Thus, the &quot;no place to put it&quot; fear no longer exists. I've even started using this technique for my factory methods to make it clear that what I am creating is, in fact, an <em>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</em>, as in this example.</p>
<div class="lang-csharp editor-colors"><div style="color:Black;background-color:White;"><pre>
<span style="color:Blue;">var</span> stations = (<span style="color:Blue;">null</span> <span style="color:Blue;">as</span> IEnumerable&lt;Station&gt;).Create();
<span style="color:Blue;">var</span> localStations = stations.GetNearby(currentLocation);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example, both the <strong>Create</strong> and <strong>GetNearby</strong> methods are extension methods found in a static class called <strong>StationExtensions</strong>.</p>
<p>So, the big advantage here is that these methods can be added anytime, meaning we don't need to create an object that we MAY need in the future. This is better adherence to the <a href="../Search/yagni.html">YAGNI</a> principle so it is a better pattern to follow. But what about disadvantages? Does it hurt us in any way to perform our collection actions this way? I'm not comfortable answering that question with an absolute &quot;no&quot; yet because I don't think I've been using this technique long enough to have covered enough ground with it, but I can certainly say that I haven't found any disadvantages yet. It seems like these extension methods are basically perfect for this type of activity. These methods do everything that the methods of a collection object do, can (and should) be put in a separate module to keep the code together, can be navigated to by Visual Studio in the same way as other methods, and have the same access (<em>private</em>, <em>internal</em>, <em>public</em>) restrictions that collection objects have. About the only thing I can say that is not 100% positive about using these techniques is that the <em>(null as IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;)</em> syntax to create a local variable instance to call the class factory from is not quite as elegant as I'd like it to be.</p>
<p>So you tell me, do you still create collection objects? Have you found any reason why using extension methods in this way is not as good as putting those methods into a strongly-typed collection? Sound off in the Fediverse <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a> and let's talk about it.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Optimization Presentation</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-10-21 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: event" class="small" href="../Search/event.html">event</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I hope you’ve had an opportunity to see my presentation, “Dynamic Optimization – One Technique all Programmers Should Know” at a Code Camp or User Group near you.  If so, and you want to have a copy of the slide deck for your very own, you can see it embedded below, or use the direct link to the Powerpoint <a href="http://1drv.ms/1W5kd1J">here</a>.</p>
<p>The subject of this presentation is using a technique called Dynamic Programming to solve problems that have more than one possible solution.  This technique works very well when used to solve problems that are recursive in nature.  One of the best things about this technique is that it guarantees that the solution it produces is the best possible solution.</p>
<p>We look at three examples during the presentation, the first is done only “on paper” and is an example of using this technique to solve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack problem</a>. The second example is done in pseudo-code and solves a linear best-path problem in the game of Chutes &amp; Ladders.  Finally, we drop into Visual Studio to solve a 2-dimensional best-path problem.  Sample code for both of the last 2 examples can be found in <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/dpdemo">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on my <a href="../Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html">Speaking Engagements Page</a> for opportunities to see this presentation live. If you are a user group or conference organizer, you can <a href="../contact.html">contact me</a> to schedule an in-person presentation. This presentation is a lot of fun to deliver and has been received extremely well at Code Camps and User Groups across the country.</p>

    <h3>Simplify Your API</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-10-12 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>If you are building an API for other Developers to use, you will find out two things very quickly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developers don't read documentation (you probably already know this).</li>
<li>If your API depends on its documentation to get developers to understand and discover its features, it is likely that it will not be used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, there are some simple mechanisms for wrapping complex APIs and making their functionality both easy to use, and highly discoverable. An API that uses tools like IntelliSense in Visual Studio to make its features discoverable by the downstream developer is far more likely to be adopted then one that doesn't. In recent years, additions to the C# language have made creating a Domain Specific Language that uses a fluent syntax for nearly any API into a simple process.</p>
<h4>Create the Context</h4>
<p>The 1st step in simplifying any API is to provide a single starting point for the downstream developer to interact with. In most cases, the best practice is to use the façade pattern to define a context that holds our entity collections. Each collection of entities becomes a property on the context object. These properties all return an IQueryable&lt;Entity&gt;. For example, in the EnumerableStack demo solution on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/SimpleAPI">https://github.com/bsstahl/SimpleAPI</a>), I created an object Bss.EnumerableStack.Data.EnumerableStack to provide this functionality. It has two properties, Posts and Questions, each of which returns an IQueryable&lt;Post&gt;. It is these properties that will be used to access the data from our API.</p>
<p>The context object, on top of becoming the single point of entry for downstream developers, also hides any complexities in the construction logic of the underlying data source. That is, if there is any configuration or other setup required to access the upstream data provider (such as web service access or database connections), much of the complexity of that construction can be hidden from the API user. A good example of this can be seen in the FluentStack demo solution from the same GitHub repository. There, the Bss.FluentStack.Data.OData.FluentStack context object wraps the functionality of constructing the connection to the StackOverflow OData web service.</p>
<h4>Extend Our Language</h4>
<p>Now that we have data to access, it's time for us to extend our domain specific language to provide tools to make accessing this data simpler for the API caller. We can use Extension methods on IQueryable&lt;Entity&gt; to create custom filters for our data. By creating extension methods that accept IQueryable&lt;Entity&gt; as a parameter and return the same, we can create methods that can be chained together to form a fluent syntax that will perform complex filtering. For example, in the EnumerableStack solution , the Questions, WithAcceptedAnswer and TaggedWith methods found in the Bss.EnumerableStack.Data.Extensions module, can all be used to execute queries on the data exposed by the properties of our context object, as shown below:</p>
<p><code>var results = new EnumerableStack().Posts.WithAcceptedAnswer().TaggedWith(&quot;odata&quot;);</code></p>
<p>In this case, both the WithAcceptedAnswer and TaggedWith filters are applied to the data. The best part about these methods are that they are visible in Intellisense (once the namespace has been brought into scope with a Using statement) making the functionality easy to discover and use.</p>
<p>Another big advantage of creating these extension methods is that they can hide the complexity of the lower level API. Here, the WithAcceptedAnswer method is wrapping a where clause that filters for those posts that have an AcceptedAnswerId property that is non-null. It may not be obvious to a downstream API consumer that the definition of a post with an &quot;accepted answer&quot; is one where the AcceptedAnswerId has a value. Our API hides that implementation detail and allows the consumer to simply request what is needed. Similarly, the TaggedWith method hides the fact that the StackOverflow API stores tags in lower-case, within angle-brackets, and with all tags on a post joined into a single string. To search for tags, the consumer would need to know this, and take all appropriate actions when searching for a tag if we didn't hide that complexity in the TaggedWith method.</p>
<h4>Simplify Query Predicates</h4>
<p>A predicate is a function that accepts an entity as a parameter, and returns a boolean value. These functions are often used in the Where clause of a query to indicate which objects should be included in the result set. For example, in the query below</p>
<p><code>var results = new EnumerableStack().Posts.Where(p =&gt; p.Parent == null);</code></p>
<p>the function expression p =&gt; p.Parent == null is a predicate that returns true if the Parent property of the entity is null. For each entity passed to the function, the value of that property is tested, and if null, the entity is included in the results of the query. Here we are using a Lambda Expression to provide a delegate to our function. One of the coolest things about Linq is that we can now represent this expression in a variable of type Expression&lt;Func&lt;Entity, bool&gt;&gt;, that is, a Lambda expression of a function that takes an Entity and returns a boolean. This is pretty awesome because if we can store it in a variable, we can pass it around and enable extension methods like this one, as found in the Asked class of the Bss.EnumerableStack.Data library:</p>
<pre><code>public static Expression&lt;Func&lt;Post, bool&gt;&gt; InLast(TimeSpan span)
   {
   return p =&gt; p.CreationDate &gt; DateTime.UtcNow.Subtract(span);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>This method accepts a TimeSpan object and returns the Lambda Expression type useable as a predicate. The input TimeSpan is subtracted from the current DateTime UTC value, and compared to the CreationDate property of a Post entity. If the creation date of the Post is later than 30-days prior to the current date, the function returns true. Since this InLast method is static on a class called Asked, we can use it like this:</p>
<p><code>var results = new EnumerableStack().Questions.Where(Asked.InLast(TimeSpan.FromDays(30));</code></p>
<p>Which will return questions that were asked in the last 30 days. This becomes even simpler to understand if we add a method extending Int called Days that returns a Timespan, like this:</p>
<pre><code>public static TimeSpan Days(this int value)
   {
   return TimeSpan.FromDays(value);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>allowing our expression to become:</p>
<p><code>var results = new EnumerableStack().Questions.Where(Asked.InLast(30.Days());</code></p>
<h4>Walking through the Process</h4>
<p>In my conference sessions, Simplify Your API: Creating Maintainable and Discoverable Code, I walk through this process on the FluentStack demo code. We take a query created against the StackOverflow OData API that starts off looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>var questions = new StackOverflowService.Entities(new Uri(_serviceRoot))
   .Posts.Where(p =&gt; p.Parent == null &amp;&amp; p.AcceptedAnswerId != null
   &amp;&amp; p.CreationDate &gt; DateTime.UtcNow.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromDays(30))
   &amp;&amp; p.Tags.Contains(&quot;&lt;odata&gt;&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>and convert it, one step at a time, to this:</p>
<pre><code>var questions = new FluentStack().Questions.WithAcceptedAnswer()
    .Where(Asked.InLast(30.Days)).TaggedWith(&quot;odata&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>a query that is much simpler, easier to understand, easier to create and easier to maintain. The sample code on GitHub, referenced above, and available at <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/SimpleAPI">https://github.com/bsstahl/SimpleAPI</a>, contains the FluentStack.sln example which shows how to simplify an API created with an OData source. It also contains the EnumerableStack.sln project which walks through the same process on a purely enumerable data source, that is, an implementation that will work with any collection.</p>

    <h3>Remove Any Code Your Users Don't Care About</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-09-28 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Code Coverage has been the topic of a number of conversations lately, most recently after the last <a href="https://www.meetup.com/sevdnug/events/223863304/">Southeast Valley .NET User Group</a> meeting where <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremybytes">Jeremy Clark</a> presented his great talk, <a href="http://jeremybytes.com/Demos.aspx#UTMMF">Unit Testing Makes Me Faster</a>.  During this presentation, Jeremy eponymized, on my behalf, something I've been saying for a while, that <a href="https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/2015/02/unit-test-coverage-what-parts-of-your.html">the part of an application that you don't need to test is the part that your users don't care about</a>. That is, if your users care about something in your application, you should be writing tests that ensure that the users' needs are fulfilled by your code. This has never really been a controversial statement, just one that sometimes gets lost in the myriad of information about unit testing and test driven development.</p>
<p>Where the conversation got really interesting was when we started discussing what should happen if you decide that a piece of code really isn't important to your users.  It is my assertion that code which is deemed unimportant enough to the user that it might not be tested, should be removed from the project, even if is part of a standard implementation.  I will attempt to justify this assertion by using the example of a property implementation that supports the <em>INotifyPropertyChanged</em> interface.</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/CodeCoverageDemoProperty_2.png" alt="Code Coverage Results -- Standard Property Implementation" /></p>
<p><strong>A visualization of the results of Code Coverage analysis on a typical property implementation. The blue highlights represent code that is covered by tests, the red highlights represent code that is NOT covered by tests.</strong></p>
<p>In this example, we have a property getter and setter. The getter simply returns the value stored in the internal member. However the setter holds some actual logic.  In this case, the new value being set is compared to the current value of the property.  If the property value is changing, the update is made and a method called that fires a notification event indicating that the value of the property has changed.  This is a fairly common implementation, especially for View-Model layer code.</p>
<p><strong>Decision: Do my users care about this feature?</strong></p>
<p>The conditional in this code is designed to skip the assignment and the change notification if the property value is not really changing.  If we were to eliminate the conditional, it would impact the users of this code in the following ways?</p>
<ol>
<li>A few CPU cycles may be wasted on an assignment that isn't doing anything</li>
<li>An event indicating the property was changed would fire incorrectly</li>
</ol>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, the performance hit from item 1 is trivial and can be ignored.  Item 2 however is a bit more complicated.  Unless I know for certain that firing the event when the property is not really changing isn't a problem, I have to assume it is a problem, since there are any number of things that could happen as a result of having an event fire.  Often, when this event fires it will cause a refresh of the bound data to the UI elements.  This may have a significant impact on performance, or it may not.  There may also be additional actions taken by the programmers of this event client that may not be foreseeable when designing this layer.  If the circumstances are such that I know there will be no problems if the event fires more often than it should, then I can probably conclude that my users don't care about this code.  In all other circumstances, I should probably conclude that they do.</p>
<p><strong>Decision: Should I remove this code?</strong></p>
<p>If I have concluded that my users care about the code, then my path is clear, I should leave the code in place and write tests to make sure that <em>the event fires when it should, and only when it should</em>.  However, if I have concluded that my users don't care about this particular code, then I have another decision to make.  I need to decide if I should leave the code untested but in place, remove the code from my project, or leave it in and write tests for it anyway.</p>
<p>If the feature is not important to the users and there is no likelihood that the feature will become important to the users in the future, then the code should not be there. Period.  We cannot waste time and effort supporting code that our users will not need. Scope-creep is a real danger to any project and should be avoided at all costs, even on the small stuff.  Lots of small stuff adds up to big stuff, especially over the lifespan of any non-trivial application.</p>
<p>So, if the features are important to the users, we test them, if they are unimportant to the users, we remove them. No controversy here. The questions come in when there is a likelihood that the feature could become important in the future, or if the feature is important to someone other than the users, such as the developers.</p>
<p>Suppose we decide that the users are likely to request this feature in the future.  Wouldn't it be easier just to implement the feature now, when we are already in the code and familiar with it?  My answer to this is to fall back on <strong>YAGNI</strong>. <em>You Ain't Gonna Need It</em>, has proven itself a valuable principal for preventing scope-creep. Even if you think it is pretty likely that you'll need something later, the reality is that you probably won’t. Based on this principal, we should not be putting features into our projects that are not needed right now.</p>
<p>But what about the situation where code is important to someone other than the users, for example, the developers?  In this case, we have to decide if the code really is important, or is it just another case where the YAGNI principal should be applied.  Technical requirements can be legitimate, but any requirement that is not directly in support of the user's needs is a smell that should be investigated.  In the case of our property setter, saying that standardization is important and using that logic to make standardization a requirement sounds a lot like saying &quot;I think this feature may be important someday&quot; and it probably falls to YAGNI to keep it out of our code.  That being said, if there is a technical requirement that is truly needed, it should be tested like any other important requirement. For a little more information on this, see my earlier analysis <a href="..//Posts/Conflict-of-Interest-YAGNI-vs-Standardization.html">Conflict of Interest: Yagni vs. Standardization</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How About we Leave It and Just Don't Test It?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to remember that we shouldn't simply leave code untested in our production code, even if the users don't really care about it right now. If we do so, and the feature becomes important in the future, we will almost certainly end up with code that is important to our users, but is untested and therefore at-risk.  We are unlikely to go back into an application and just add tests for a feature that already exists simply because that feature is now important when it wasn't earlier.  We'd like to think we would, but the fact is that we won't. No, leaving the code in the application, but untested, is not an option.</p>
<p><strong>The Case for 100% Code Coverage</strong></p>
<p>So, we want to remove any code that is not currently required by our users, and test all code that is truly needed. If you have come along with me on this you may now realize that <strong>100% code coverage is actually a reasonable goal</strong>, since that would be the result of removing all unneeded code and testing all needed code.  This is not to say that it is reasonable to use Code Coverage as a metric with which to judge a development team, but instead it should be considered as a tool that can help identify scope-creep and missing tests.  Since we are testing all code that our users care about, and not adding any code that the users don't care about, we should expect to approach 100% code coverage in order to have a good chance of producing well-tested, maintainable code that gives us the flexibility and confidence to refactor ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Code Coverage sometimes gets a bad reputation because it can be easy to game. That is, it is not a good metric of success for a development team. However, it is a <em>magnificent</em>tool to help you identify places where tests are missing.  It won't tell you where your tests are not doing what they need to do, but it will tell you when you have a piece of code that is not exercised by any tests. If you are a TDD (Test-Driven-Development) practitioner, as I am, Code Coverage will tell you when you’ve gotten ahead of yourself and written code before writing a test for it.  This is especially valuable for those who are just learning TDD, but never loses its value no matter how experienced you are at TDD.</p>

    <h3>Introducing TestHelperExtensions</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-08-26 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <h2>TL;DR Version</h2>
<p>I've released a new Open-Source library of extension methods that can be used to create more effective unit and integration tests. This library is called TestHelperExtensions. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/testhelperextensions">GitHub</a> (pull requests welcome), a .NET 4 package is available via <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/TestHelperExtensions/">NuGet</a>, and the documentation is available <a href="http://testhelperextensions.cognitiveinheritance.com">here</a>. The goal is to allow anyone to have access to the same set of test helpers I have been using, and building up, for many years.</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>I have been giving Test Driven Development (TDD) sessions at code camps and conferences for a number of years. During those sessions, I spend a lot of time in code, building up a test suite for a production application, and demonstrating the process I use for TDD. Part of this process is using a set of extension methods to perform common tasks, such as generating test data, and doing comparisons of DateTime values. Many people have asked for access to this library during these sessions and my answer has always been the same, &quot;you can grab it from the sample code&quot;. Now, I've decided to make it easier for anyone to include it in their projects via NuGet, and to allow the community the opportunity to extend and modify the library on GitHub.</p>
<h2>Going Forward</h2>
<p>I still have a small backlog of features I'd like to add to this tool. After that, It's up to you what happens with it. If you have a feature suggestion, please let me know. <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a> is the best place to start a conversation about this, or any development topic with me. You can also create an <a href="https://github.com/bsstahl/TestHelperExtensions/issues">issue on GitHub</a>, or simply submit a pull request. I'd love to hear how you are using this library, and anything that can be done to make it more effective for you.</p>

    <h3>“One Reason to Change” Means the Code</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-07-06 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>There was some confusion last week at the SoCalCodeCamp about what the phrase “One Reason to Change” actually means.  As you probably know, the Single Responsibility Principle states that every class should have one and only one responsibility within the system. A common check for adherence to this principal is that the object has only one reason to change. However, it is important to realize that this is referring to the code (the class), not the state of the object (the instance).  The state of the object may have many reasons to change, however, we as developers should have only 1 reason to change the code for our objects.  For example, if the object is in the business-rules layer, we should only have to change the code if the business rules change.  Likewise, if the object is in the data tier, it should only need code changes if the structure of the data changes.</p>

    <h3>Are you Ready for the Next Episode?</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2015-06-29 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>In the last episode of “<a href="../Posts/Windows-8-Store-Development-for-Enterprise-Devs.html">Refactoring my App Development Mojo</a>”, I explained how I had discovered my passion for building Windows Store applications by using a hybrid solution of HTML5 with very minimal JavaScript, bound to a view-model written in C# running as a Windows Runtime Component, communicating with services written in C# using WCF.  The goal was to do as much of the coding as possible in the technologies I was very comfortable with, C# and HTML, and minimize the use of those technologies which I had never gotten comfortable with, namely JavaScript and XAML.</p>
<p>While this was an interesting and somewhat novel approach, it turned out to have a few fairly significant drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using this hybrid approach meant there were two runtimes that had to be initialized and operating during execution, a costly drain on system resources, especially for mobile devices.</li>
<li>Applications built using this methodology would run well on Windows 8 and 8.1 machines, as well as Windows Phone devices, but not  on the web, or on Android or iDevices.</li>
<li>The more complex the applications became, the more I hand to rely on JavaScript anyway, even despite putting as much logic as possible into the C# layers.</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of these drawbacks, I now feel like it is time for me to get over my fear of moving to JavaScript. Yes, it is weakly typed (at least for now). Yes, its implementation of many object-oriented concepts leave a lot to be desired (at least for now), yes, it can sometimes make you question your own logical thinking, or even your sanity, with how it handles certain edge-cases. All that being said however, JavaScript, in some form, is the clear winner when it comes to web applications. There is no question that, if you are building standard front-ends for you applications, you need JavaScript.</p>
<p>So, it seems that it is time for me to move to a more standard front-end development stack.  I need one that is cross-platform, ideally providing a good deployment story for web, PC, tablet &amp; phone, and supporting all major platforms including Android, iDevices &amp; Windows phones and tablets.  It also needs to be standards-based, and work using popular frameworks so that my apps can be kept up-to-date with the latest technology.</p>
<p>I believe I have found this front-end platform in <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a>. Cordova takes HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 apps that can already work on the web, and builds them into hybrid apps that can run on virtually any platform including iPhones and iPads, Android phones and tablets, and Windows PCs, phones and tablets. Cordova has built-in support in Visual Studio 2015, which I have been playing with for a little while and seems to have real promise.  There is also the popular <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic Framework</a> for building Cordova apps which I plan to learn more about over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>I’ll keep you informed of my progress and let you know if this does indeed turn out to be the best way for me to build apps. Stay tuned.</p>

    <h3>Two Features you Need in Your Service SLAs</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2014-09-22 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>To allow ourselves to create the best possible services for our clients, it is important to make those services as flexible and maintainable as possible.  Building services in an agile way helps us to create better services, however it makes it more likely that our service interface will, at some point, have to change.  Changing a service interface after publication is, and should be, a well gated, well thought-out process. By changing the interface, you are changing the contract your service has with all of your clients, and you are probably requiring every one of the service consumers to change.  This should not be done lightly. However, there are a few things that can be done to minimize the impacts of these changes. Several of these things require agreements with the clients up front.  As a result, these items should be included in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the service providers and the consumers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Caveat</strong>: I am a solution architect, not an expert in creating service level agreements.  Typically, my only involvement with SLAs is to object when I can’t get what I need in one from a service provider. My intent here is to call-out a few things that all service providers should include in their SLAs to maintain the flexibility of their APIs. There are many other things that should be included in any good SLA that I will not be discussing here.</em></p>
<p>The two items that I believe should be included in all service SLAs are the requirements that the clients support both Lax Versioning and Forward Compatible Contracts.  Each of these items is discussed in some detail below.</p>
<h3>Lax Versioning</h3>
<p>Lax Versioning allows us to add new, optional members to the data contract of the service without that change being considered a breaking change. Some modern service frameworks provide this behavior by default and many of the changes we might make to a service fall into this category.  By reducing the number of changes that are considered breaking, we can lessen the burden on our implementation teams, reducing coordination requirements with service consumers, and shortening time to market of these changes.</p>
<p>One of the major impacts that Lax Versioning has is that it requires us to either avoid schema validation altogether, or to use specially designed, versionable schemas to do our validation.  I recommend avoiding schema validation wherever reasonable and possible.</p>
<h3>Forward Compatible Contracts</h3>
<p>Forward Compatible Contracts, also known as the Round-Tripping of Unknown Data, requires that the service round-trip any additional data it gets, but doesn’t understand, back to the client and that clients round-trip any additional data they get, but don’t understand, back to the server.  This behavior reduces the coupling between client and server for changes that are covered by Lax Versioning, but need to retain the additional data throughout the call life-cycle.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we were version a contract such that we added an additional address type to an employee entity  (V1 only has home address, V2 has home and work addresses).  If we change the service to return the V2 employee prior to changing the client, the client will accept the additional (optional) address type because we have already required Lax Versioning, but it will not know what to do with the information.  If a V1 client without round-tripping support sends that employee back to the server, the additional address type will not be included.  If however, the V1 client supports this round-tripping behavior, it will still be unable to use the data in the additional address field, but will return it to the server if the entity is sent back in a subsequent call.  These behaviors with a V1 client and a V2 service are shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/image_4.png" alt="Forward Compatible Contracts" /></p>
<p>If the same practice is used on the server side, then we can decouple the client and server from many implementation changes.  Clients would be free to implement the new versions of contracts as soon as they are ready, without having to wait for the service to roll-out.  Likewise, many changes at the service side could be made knowing that data sent down to the clients will not be lost when it is returned to the server.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Making changes to the contract of existing services is a process that has risk, and requires quite a bit of coordination with clients. Some of the risks and difficulties involved in the process can be mitigated by including just 2 requirements in the Service Level Agreements of our services.  By requiring clients to implement Lax Versioning and making our contracts Forward Compatible, we can reduce the impact of some changes, and decouple others such that we significantly reduce the risk involved in making these changes, and improve our time-to-market for these deployments.</p>

    <h3>Conflict of Interest -- YAGNI vs. Standardization</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2014-07-28 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>While working on the OSS project mentioned in my <a href="../Posts/New-OSS-Project.html">previous post</a>, I have run across a dilemma where two of the principles I try to work by are in conflict. The two principles in question are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>YAGNI</strong> - <em>You aint gonna need it</em>, which prescribes not coding anything unless the need already exists. This principle is a core of Test Driven Development of which I am a practitioner and a strong proponent.</li>
<li><strong>Standardization</strong> - Where components, especially those built for use by other developers, are implemented in a common way in order to shorten the learning curve of future developers who will use the component and to reduce implementation bugs.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have run across this type of decision many times before and have noted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>YAGNI is usually correct, if you don't need it now, you are unlikely to need it in the future.</li>
<li>Standard implementations which are built incompletely tend to be implemented badly later because there tends to be more time pressure further along into projects, and because it is often implemented by someone other than the original programmer who may not be as familiar with the pattern.</li>
<li>The fact that there is less time pressure early in projects is another great reason to respect YAGNI because if we are always writing unnecessary code early in projects, a project can quickly become late.</li>
<li>Implementing code that is not currently required by the use-cases being built requires the addition of unit tests that are specific to the underlying functionality rather than user requested features. While often valuable, the very fact that we are writing such tests is a code smell.</li>
<li>Since I use FxCop Code Analysis built-in to Visual Studio, not supplying all features of a standard implementation may require overriding one or more analysis rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking all of this into account, the simplest solution (which is usually the best) is to override the FxCop rules in the code, and continue without implementing the unneeded, albeit standard features.</p>
<p>Do you disagree with my decision? Tell me why <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>New OSS Project</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2014-07-11 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I recently started working on a set of open-source projects for Code Camps and other community conferences with my friend Rob Richardson <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rich">(@rob_rich</a>). In addition to doing some good for the community, I expect these projects, which I will describe in more detail in upcoming posts, to allow me to experiment with several elements of software development that I have been looking forward to trying out. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Git as a source control repository</li>
<li>Using nUnit within Visual Studio as a test runner</li>
<li>Solving an optimization problem in C#</li>
<li>Getting to work on a shared project with and learning from Rob</li>
</ul>
<p>As an enterprise developer, I have been using MSTest and Team Foundation Server since they were released. My last experience with nUnit was probably about 10 years ago, and I have never used Git before. My source control experience prior to TFS was in VSS and CVS, and all of that was at least 6 or 7 years ago.</p>
<p>So far, I have to say I'm very pleased with both Git for source control, and nUnit for tests. Honestly, other than for the slight syntactical changes, I really can't tell that I'm using nUnit instead of MSTest. The integration with Visual Studio, once the appropriate extensions are added, is seamless. Using Git is a bit more of a change, but I am really liking the workflow it creates. I have found myself, somewhat automatically, committing my code to the local repository after each step of the Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle, and then pushing all of those commits to the server after each full completion of that cycle. This is a good, natural workflow that gives the benefits of frequent commits, without breaking the build for other developers on the project. It also has the huge advantage of being basically unchanged in a disconnected environment like an airplane (though those are frequently not disconnected anymore).</p>
<p>The only possible downside I can see so far is the risk presented by the fact that code committed to the local repository, is not yet really safe. Committing code has historically been a way of protecting ourselves from disc crashes or other catastrophes. In this workflow, it is the push to the server, not the act of committing code, that gives us that redundancy protection. As long as we remember that we don't have this redundancy until we push, and make those pushes part of the requirements of our workflow, I think the benefits of frequent local commits greatly outweigh any additional risk.</p>
<p>As to the other two items on my list, I have already learned a lot from both working with Rob and in working toward implementing the optimization solution. Even though we've only been working on this for a few days, and have had only 1 pairing session to this point, I feel quite confident that both the community and I will get great benefit from these projects.</p>
<p>In my next post, I'll discuss what these projects are, and how we plan on implementing them.</p>

    <p>For those who saw my code camp presentation, “SOA – Beyond the Buzzwords”, you can find the slide deck <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=5D45DDF99C1E1BCC%21219769">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is much more to building a Service Oriented Architecture than just creating services. SOA services can be much more difficult to build, requiring more analysis and design work up-front than a non-service-enabled system or a system that relies on CRUD-style data services. In this session, we will look at real-world examples of SOAs, examining what a good SOA might look like, what conditions present a good opportunity to use a Service Oriented Architecture, and how we can make the process more agile. We will also look at some practical tips to help make your services more extensible and maintainable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who haven’t yet seen this presentation, I will be giving this session at several other code camps and user groups around the US between now and the end of the year.  Keep an eye on my <a href="..//Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html">Speaking Engagements page</a> to know where and when I will be presenting.</p>

    <h3>The Next Old New way of Thinking About App Interfaces</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2014-04-04 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>One thing I've noticed during my 30 years in software engineering is that everything old eventually becomes new again.  If you have a particular skill or preferred methodology that seems to have become irrelevant,  just wait a while, it is likely to return in some form or another.  In this case, it seems that recent announcements by Microsoft about how developers will be able to leverage the power of Cortana, are likely to revitalize the need for text processing as an input to the apps we build.</p>
<p>At one time, many years ago, we had two primary methods of letting the computer know what path we wanted to take within an application; we could select a value from a displayed (textual) menu, or, if we were getting fancy, we could provide an input box that the user could type commands into.  This latter technique was often the purview of text-only adventure games and inputs came in the form &quot;move left&quot; and &quot;look east&quot;.  While neither of these input methods was particularly exciting or &quot;natural&quot; to use today's parlance, it was only text input that allowed the full flexibility of executing nearly any application action from any location.  Now that Microsoft has announce that developers on Windows Phone, and likely other platforms, will be able to leverage the platform's built-in digital assistant named &quot;Cortana&quot; and receive inputs into their applications as text input translated from the user's speech (or directly as text typed into Cortana's input box) it makes sense for us to start thinking about our application inputs in this way again. That is, we want to consider, for each action a user might take, how the user might trigger that action by voice command.</p>
<p>It should be fairly easy to shift to this mindset if we simply imagine, on our user interfaces, a text box where the user could type a command to the app.  The commands that the user might type into this box are the commands we need to enable using the provided speech input APIs.  If we start thinking about inputs in this way now, it might help to shape our user interfaces in ways that make speech input more natural, and our applications more useful, in the coming years. Of course, this also gives us the added benefit of allowing us to reuse our old text parsing skills from that time when we wrote that adventure game…</p>

    <h3>Using Target-Specific Code in a Portable Library</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2013-06-27 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>On at least 2 occasions recently, I have heard speakers tell their audience that you cannot reference a target-specific .NET library (such as a .NET Framework 4.5 library) from a Portable Class Library.  While this is technically true, it doesn't tell nearly the whole story.  Even though we can't reference target-specific libraries, we can still USE these libraries. We can call their methods and access their properties under the right circumstances. We can gain access to these libraries via an abstraction.  My preferred method of doing this is known as Dependency Injection.</p>
<p>I'm going to give some quick background on PCLs and DI before getting into the details of how they can be used in this context. If you are familiar with Dependency Injection and .NET Portable Class Libraries you can skip these sections.</p>
<h3>.NET Portable Class Libraries (PCLs)</h3>
<p>Portable Class Libraries are .NET assemblies designed to be used by multiple target platforms in the .NET application space. You can specify which targets you want to be able to use, such as .NET 4.5, Silverlight 4, Windows Phone 8, etc.  The compiler then does the work to limit the APIs you have at your disposal in that library to only the intersection of all of the selected targets.  This guarantees that any code written in that library will work in all of those targets, but no target-specific (device-specific) functionality will be available.  These libraries are great for business-logic and other platform-independent services but are not useable for code that requires direct access to device features like the UI, camera, GPS, etc.  This code can be compiled and tested once, and then accessed from any of the selected target contexts.</p>
<h3>Dependency Injections (DI)</h3>
<p>Dependency Injection is a way of maintaining loose-coupling between application components.  Instead of having a piece of code have a direct knowledge of one of its dependencies, the code only has knowledge of an abstraction of that dependency, usually an interface. Since the client is unaware of the implementation and only has knowledge of the abstraction, the implementation of the dependency can change, and as long as it maintains compliance to the interface, the client code is unaware of the change and continues to function normally.  The correct dependency must then be &quot;injected&quot; into the calling code prior to being used.  The client only knows that the dependency implements the needed interface, but is unaware of the actual implementation.  This becomes extremely useful in unit-testing since a fake dependency such as a mock data-provider can be injected by the test context, allowing the tests to focus on the layer being tested without having to test the dependencies as well.  While this is not nearly the only reason to use DI, it is an example of an excellent benefit of its use.</p>
<h3>Injecting Target-Specific Code into PCLs</h3>
<p>Let's suppose we have a .NET Portable Class Library that implements the business logic of our application.  We want the application to be able to run on the web under ASP.NET, on Windows 8 as a Modern Windows Store App, and on Windows Phone 8.  We built the PCL using these specific targets so we know (the compiler guarantees) that this code will run in any of those platforms.  However, this code needs to get its data from somewhere, and that somewhere is different depending on what environment we are running in.  In ASP.Net for example, we may want to get the data from Session State, or from a back-end SQL Server, while in Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 we want to use their (different) implementations of isolated storage.  We can accomplish this by defining an interface that is usable by all 3 targets in a PCL.  We can then create our 3 different implementations of the storage library using target-specific code and inject the appropriate one into the constructor of one or more of the classes in the business-logic PCL.  This injection can be done directly by the parent application, which is going to be target-specific so it would have knowledge of which target is needed, or it can be done indirectly using a DI Container such as Microsoft Unity.</p>
<p>A sample app that is available in the 3 targets previously described may look something like <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=5D45DDF99C1E1BCC&amp;id=5D45DDF99C1E1BCC%21144541&amp;parId=5D45DDF99C1E1BCC%21154&amp;o=OneUp">this</a>.  The business-logic and domain layers (interfaces, exceptions, entities, etc) are both PCLs and exist for use in all 3 targets.  The UI layer and Infrastructure layers (in this case, storage) are target-specific and require a separate implementation for each target platform.  A system designed in this way can maximize the use of common, shared code while still making platform specific features available in a type-safe way.</p>
<p>If you are interested in seeing this implementation done live, you can come to one of my Code Camp talks on the subject, or request me as a speaker for your User Group by <a href="..//contact.html">Contacting Me</a>.</p>

    <h3>Programmers -- Take Responsibility for Your Program’s Output</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2013-03-03 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>You have probably seen the discussion of the “Keep Calm and Rape a Lot” T-Shirts that were made available, for a time, by an Amazon reseller.  These shirts were one of several thousand computer-generated designs offered for sale on Amazon, to be printed and shipped if anyone cared to buy one.  At first blush, and as some have pointed-out, it seems like a simple error. A verb list that contained the word “rape” was not properly vetted and therefore the offensive shirt promoting violent crime was offered for sale by mistake. No offense was intended, so, as long as the company takes the proper action of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429232420/http://www.solidgoldbomb.com/pages/our-apology">apologizing and removing the offending item</a>, all is well.  This sentiment seems to be summed-up by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305012153/http://iam.peteashton.com/keep-calm-rape-tshirt-amazon/">well-read post by Pete Ashton</a> on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because these algorithms generally mimic decisions that used to be made directly by people we have a tendency to humanise the results and can easily be horrified by what we see. But some basic understanding of how these systems work can go a long way to alleviating this dissonance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I believe it is not nearly this simple.  For one thing, I wonder about how this offensive shirt was “discovered”.  Did somebody really stumble across it in the Amazon store, or, was its existence “leaked” to generate publicity.  I don’t know the answer to this question, but if it were the case that someone at the company knew it was there, and either did nothing or worse, used it for marketing purposes, that would invalidate the “…it was computer generated” defense.  However, in my mind, that defense doesn’t hold water for another reason.  That is, we know this can happen and have the responsibility to make sure it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>The companies that use our software are responsible for the output of our programs</strong>.  If we are using a sequence of characters that could potentially form a word, those companies are responsible for the message that word conveys.  If our programs output a sequence of words that could potentially form a sentence, they are responsible for that message as well.  If the reasonable possibility exists that a message generated by these algorithms would be offensive, and visible to the public, failure to properly vet the message makes that company responsible for it.</p>
<p>This fact is made even more critical when our customers are enterprise scale clients and we are building software for use by the general public. As an example, lets look at one of the common systems for creating airline reservations which has been in operation for decades.  This system presents to the consumer a six-character alphanumeric code known as the Record Locator Number. This identifier is used for the reservation by both automated and manual systems. What do you think would happen if you were making an airline reservation, and the response, either verbally, or in text, came back with the Record Locator “FATASS”?  How about “FUKOFF” or “UBITCH”?  If the programmers who created this system had just coded a random (or incrementing) set of any 6 characters, these letter combinations would have come up, probably multiple times by now because of the sheer volume of use.  However, the system creators knew this could happen and did what needed to be done to prevent sequences with meaning from being used.  As language changes and different letter combinations have different meanings, these policies need to be reviewed and amended to include additional letter combinations. Problems like this are not new and have been solved many times before, when the clients wanted them to be solved.</p>
<p>Knowing that random combinations of words can result in meaningful, and potentially offensive sentences, we are responsible for the failure when they actually do, whether they happened “intentionally” or not.</p>

    <h3>Windows 8 Store Development for Enterprise Devs</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2013-02-28 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <h3>or, How I found my Passion for Windows 8 Store App Development</h3>
<p>Update: My first Windows Store app was published on March 27, 2013.</p>
<p>I don't have any apps in the Windows 8 Store yet. For that matter, I don't have any apps in the Windows Phone store, or the Apple or Android stores either. I have many ideas for apps, and a number of them in the works for both Windows 8 and Windows Phone, but I have nothing real to show for it yet. Nothing to show for several years of attending sessions at conferences, user groups, and code camps on building these apps; for many hours of hacking on front-end interfaces and business logic. Don’t get me wrong, I've wanted to build these apps, but I didn't have that burning desire that I usually get when I am solving problems with software. You know that desire, the one that compels you to sit in front of a computer for hours at a time until you've completed a solution. I didn't have it.</p>
<p>This recently changed for me -- let me explain.</p>
<p>I have spent most of the last 20 years building enterprise web applications that do most of the work on the server side. My user interfaces have been built in HTML, with some JavaScript for validation and Ajax for dynamic post-backs, but all business rules were housed entirely on the server in either C#, VB or something similar. Even before .NET, in the classic ASP days, my logic executed on the server with VBScript calling components created in Visual Basic. Before that, it was Pascal programs spitting out pure HTML to the console which was then redirected to the browser stream by the web server. As a result, I am very comfortable with using HTML for layout, and multi-purpose languages like C# and VB.Net for the business logic and data access.</p>
<p>In the app world however, this combination of technologies has seemed out-of-reach. In Windows Phone development, I could use C#, but needed to use XAML for layout and style, a technology that I have not yet been able to get comfortable with. For Windows 8 store apps there are more options, including HTML5/JavaScript apps, but I have never been comfortable writing code in JavaScript. The advent of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> has brought us even closer to a solution in my comfort zone where I can get almost a C# style experience with HTML5 as my layout mechanism, but I am still missing key features like LINQ and generics.</p>
<p>Enter Windows Runtime Components. I say “enter”, as if they were new -- they're not, I just apparently allowed myself to forget about them. RT Components can be written in C# (and other languages), but can be called from JavaScript or any Windows 8 Store code, just as if they were written in that same language. RT components can also call into any .NET code that can be executed in a Windows Store App. As a result, I have the power of C# and the .NET Framework at my disposal while writing a JavaScript app. All I have to do is wrap my .NET Windows Store compatible libraries in an RT component, and use JavaScript to bind it to my HTML layout. Since I have been using Portable Libraries for most of my business logic for some time now, and those libraries that aren't yet portable, are generally easily translated, most of my .NET business logic is already available for me to wrap in an RT Component.</p>
<p>With the primary business functionality done in C#, it becomes a relatively trivial exercise in JavaScript to bind my RT model to the HTML components in my UI. This experience is completely comfortable to me, and in using this process, I have found the passion I was missing for building these apps. I will have several apps in the Windows 8 store in the next few weeks with more to follow after that. I will also be writing about my methods in building these apps, from the perspective of an enterprise developer. Hopefully, this will allow others to find the passion for creating these apps as I have. In the meantime, here are a few tips you can start using now to ease the transition into building apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use portable libraries wherever possible, especially for business logic.</li>
<li>Use dependency injection to make non-portable dependencies available to portable libraries. This will allow your business logic access to platform-specific functionality (such as network access) without sacrificing portability.</li>
<li>Do as much of the work as possible in the underlying .NET libraries and keep the RT Component as thin a translation layer as possible. I will be exploring techniques for this in the near future. Possibilities here include making this layer either a View-Model or a Repository implementation.</li>
<li>The only logic in the JavaScript code should be that which is required to bind the RT Component to your controls. If you are doing more than setting event handlers and other control properties in your JavaScript, you might want to think about moving that functionality into a lower layer. This has the added benefit of making that logic potentially reusable across applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m interested to hear if there are other enterprise developers with similar stories, whose comfort zones of HTML and C# or VB have kept them from building apps as they’d like. Please contact me <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>Regain Access to the CreateUnitTests Command in VS2012</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2012-12-27 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I previously expressed my annoyance <a href="..//Posts/The-Missing-e2809cCreate-Unit-Teste2809d-feature-in-Visual-Studio-2012.html">here</a> and <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/3-017">here (starting at 01:02:06)</a> about the lack of the Create Unit Tests feature in Visual Studio 2012, similar to the one in Visual Studio 2010.  It is interesting that none of the Microsoft people I’ve spoken to on the issue were able to provide me with a reasonable work-around, but apparently, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1741116/intrueder">intrueder</a>, a commenter at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9547055/where-is-the-create-unit-tests-selection">Stack Overflow</a>, has.  It turns out that the functionality was not removed from the Visual Studio product, just from the context menu. Therefore, we can give ourselves access to the command again by assigning a keyboard shortcut to it.  The steps to do so are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio 2012, select <strong>Options</strong> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu on the top menu bar.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Environment</strong> section of the dialog, select <strong>Keyboard</strong>.  This will show you a list of commands and their keyboard shortcuts if they have one.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Show commands containing</strong> box, type <strong>CreateUnitTests</strong>.  You should see the command window filter down to the <strong>EditorContextmenus.CodeWindow.CreateUnitTests</strong> command, which will be highlighted.</li>
<li>If there is anything shown in the <strong>Shortcuts for selected command</strong> drop-down, you are already done.  You can use whatever key sequence is listed to access the command as described below.</li>
<li>If there is nothing shown, you’ll need to assign a keyboard shortcut.  Press the key sequence you’d like to use while in the <strong>Press shortcut keys</strong> text box.  If that shortcut is already assigned, the <strong>Shortcut currently used by</strong> drop-down will change to show how the key sequence is currently used.  You may have to try several key combinations before you find one that you are comfortable using, especially if you use a product like Resharper which maps a bunch of additional shortcuts on top of the Visual Studio default key mappings.</li>
<li>Once you decide on a key sequence and those keys (or key) appear in the <strong>Press shortcut keys</strong> text box, press the <strong>Assign</strong> button to map the sequence to the command.  You can now use that key sequence to access the CreateUnitTests command as described below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that a shortcut is setup, all you have to do is place the cursor within the scope that you want to create unit tests for (a namespace, class or method) and invoke the key sequence.  The command should be activated as it was in Visual Studio 2010.  I have been using this for a little while and it is working quite well for me, but I don’t make use of nearly all of the features of this command.  I’ll be interested to hear if you have any troubles using this tool in this way. You can contact me <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a> if you have any comments.</p>

    <h3>The Missing “Create Unit Test” feature in Visual Studio 2012</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2012-09-16 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I am loving many of the improvements made in Visual Studio 2012.  The performance and overall user experience of the test runner has improved tremendously from Visual Studio 2010 and the IDE is generally a joy to use.  <em><strong>Unfortunately, I can’t use it</strong></em>. It is missing one of the key features I use in my development workflow, that is, the “Create Unit Test” option.  This function, in VS2010, generates the stub of unit tests based on the interfaces of the selected methods.  It is hard for me to imagine why this feature was left out of Visual Studio 2012, but it needs to be put back in immediately.</p>
<p>Please let Microsoft know how you feel about the absence of this feature in VS2012 by voting the feature request up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130311134957/http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2748862-add-create-unit-tests-menu-option-back-">UserVoice</a>.</p>

    <h3>Code Sample for My TDD Kickstart Sessions</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2012-02-13 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>The complete, working application for my <a href="../Posts/NET-TDD-Kickstart.html">.NET TDD Kickstart</a> sessions can be found <a href="../Files/TDDKickstart.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>Unzip the files into a solution folder and open the <strong>Demo.sln</strong> solution in a version of Visual Studio 2010 that has Unit Testing capability (Professional, Premium or Ultimate).  Immediately, you should be able to compile the whole solution, and successfully execute the tests in the <strong>Bss.QueueMonitor.Test</strong> and <strong>Bss.Timing.Test</strong> libraries.</p>
<p>To get the tests in the other two test libraries (<strong>Bss.QueueMonitor.Data.EF.Test</strong> &amp; <strong>Bss.QueueMonitor.IntegrationTest</strong>) to pass, you will need to create the database used to store the monitored data in the data-tier and integration tests, and enable MSMQ on your system so that a queue to be monitored can be created for the Integration test.</p>
<p>The solution is configured to use a SQLExpress database called <strong>TDDDemo</strong>.  You can use any name or SQL implementation you like, you’ll just need to update the configuration of all of the test libraries to use the new connection.  The script to execute in the new database to create the table needed to run the tests can be found in the Bss.QueueMonitor.Data.EF library and is called <strong>QueueDepthModel.edmx.sql</strong>.</p>
<p>You can install Message Queuing on computers running Windows 7 by using <strong>Programs and Features</strong> in the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.  You do not need to create any specific queue because the integration test creates a queue for each test individually, then deletes the queue when the test is complete.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this sample, please start a conversation in the Fediverse <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a> or <a href="../contact.html">Contact Me</a>.</p>

    <h3>Order Matters in the Rhino Mocks Fluent Interface</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2012-01-16 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I noticed something interesting with Rhino Mocks today while testing some demo code:
<code>Rhino.Mocks.Expect.Call(myDependency.MyMethod(param1)).Return(result).Repeat.Times(5);</code>
behaves as I anticipated; it expects the call to <strong>MyMethod</strong> to be repeated 5 times and returns the value of <strong>result</strong> all 5 times. Meanwhile:
<code>Rhino.Mocks.Expect.Call(myDependency.MyMethod(param1)).Repeat.Times(5).Return(result);</code>
also has the expectation of 5 executions, but it returns the value of <strong>result</strong> only once. The other 4 executions return <strong>0</strong>.</p>
<p>When I think about it now, it makes sense, but it wasn't the behavior I originally expected.</p>

    <h3>Why I Am Attending the Pluralsight “Algorithms and Data Structures” Webcast</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2011-08-24 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: event" class="small" href="../Search/event.html">event</a>&nbsp;<a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>When I started at Arizona State University (ASU) about twenty-six years ago, I’d already been programming for five or six years, and building applications for a year or two.  I’d done things like create hacking tools and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardialing">WarGames dialers</a> for my own use, and I’d built a few applications for businesses where I was doing lookups and filing information that was specific to that business, but all of that was very heavy on code and light on technique and reusability.  I knew how to use variables and arrays, I knew how to make the computer do what I wanted it to do, but I didn’t know how to write good code.  At ASU, there were two classes that I had take freshman year that were part of the Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences core, that really woke me up to the world of Computer Science and the things that we, as engineers, can do with our code.  Those classes were “Data Structures in Pascal” and “Discreet Mathematics”.  These two classes are really the only classes where I have specific memories of the things I learned so long ago.</p>
<p>I remember, very clearly, in the data structures class, learning about linked-lists.  I remember the realm of possibilities that I saw when introduced to this data structure.  This really very simple data structure showed me tremendous power as a flexible, reusable foundational element, that dwarfed arrays and the other tools I knew at the time.  Linked lists showed me how I could hold the same values as I held in an array with addition metadata that gave me the tools to access the values in a different way, in a way that made more sense for the use-case.  I saw in these structures a tool I could use to build reusable frameworks that could operate on data in a way that was much more use-case specific.  For example, I could use linked-lists to create a queue structure.  Then, if the use-case dictated, I could extend that structure to hold a priority and make the queue priority based.  These things, while possible just using flat arrays, were much more difficult and harder to reuse.  Other structures like binary-trees had impact on me as well, but nothing like the fundamental power of the linked-list.</p>
<p>I remember, in the discreet math class, learning about algorithms that were, in effect, practical uses of math for programmers.  Although that class was not officially geared towards programmers, it was very easy to see why it was a core requirement for the College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences.  I remember learning about various sorting algorithms and encryption methods, optimum path algorithms and best-fit criteria.  Basically, I learned ways of applying mathematics to everyday problems I faced when writing code.  As with the data structures class, my horizons were significantly expanded by this knowledge and I have used these tools, and my understanding of these tools, to some degree every day since.</p>
<p>For me, making the decision that I wanted to be a software engineer, as opposed to a hardware engineer, didn’t occur until after I started college.  The two classes I have described, had a big impact on proving to me that my talent, and my passion, was for software and that programming was the path that I wanted to take in life.</p>
<p>Now, I see an opportunity, 26 years later, to refresh my memory and update my skills on some of these topics.  There have been many changes in software engineering since my time in college.  The .NET Framework now provides many of the foundational structures I use daily, and, with the help of generics, those structures will often work in a strongly-typed way on any data type I choose.  These topics helped establish the course of my career and I am looking forward to seeing how the tools, and the use of these tools, has changed over time.  While I realize that I cannot recreate the “eureka experience” of my original awakening, and that you cannot squeeze 2 full-semester classes into a 1-hour presentation, I am still very excited about attending the Pluralsight webcast on Algorithms and Data Structures tomorrow.</p>

    <h3>Microsoft Developers and HTML5</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2011-07-29 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Warning: Speculation Alert!</p>
<p>While attending the Pittsburgh GiveCamp, I had something of an epiphany about Microsoft’s HTML5 strategy. Looking back at it now it seems so obvious, but at the time it felt like a revelation, so I want to share that experience with you.  You should be warned however that this is not based on any actual knowledge.  I am not a Microsoft insider and I have no information that any other developer who uses Microsoft technologies doesn’t have access to.  These thoughts are purely speculative, but they make sense to me so I felt the need to share them and I look forward to your comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that Microsoft will make HTML5/CSS3/ECMAScript a 1st-class language within the .NET stack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, just about everything that can be done in HTML5, can be done in Silverlight and WPF.  Because Microsoft has already spent the time and effort building those technologies into the .NET Framework, there is already the capability in the Microsoft Intermediate Language (IL), which all .NET code compiles down to, to support the actions that might be needed in an HTML5 application.  Certainly, the standard HTML UI elements have an equivalent in the XAML-based world of WPF and Silverlight.  In addition, there is already style support similar to CSS, and we know there is strong programmability support.  So, when you get down to it, all of the framework pieces are in place to compile an HTML5 application into IL.  Once compiled, most likely into an .exe file, this HTML5 application could be executed in exactly the same way as any Windows desktop application.  I believe Microsoft will be announcing this capability as one of its key features of .NET 5 at their Build conference in September to take advantage of the marketing synergy between the .NET 5 and HTML5 brands.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a workflow where you use File –&gt; New Project in Visual Studio to create an HTML5 project, build HTML5 pages along with your script, style and other resources, and then can publish the project as either a standard HTML website, or as a .NET executable file to be run on Windows 8, or even earlier versions of Windows if they have the .NET framework 5.0 installed?  I can imagine it easily, and I like what I see when I do.  This may be why Microsoft is billing the Build conference as for more than just Professional Developers.  That is, web designers and hobbyists will now also have the ability to create Windows desktop applications simply by utilizing the web skills they already possess.</p>
<p>As for the future of WPF and Silverlight, I speculate that, if Microsoft takes the path that I have described, it practically ensures the survival of the XAML technologies.  The HTML5 spec will be constantly evolving and Microsoft will need to continue to add features to the framework to support those new capabilities.  Once in the framework, Silverlight and WPF can add those same or similar features for almost nothing, simply by adding the language support in XAML or C#/VB.Net.  Microsoft will also have two platforms available in Silverlight and WPF to use to test features that are not yet in the HTML5 spec.</p>
<p>It is likely that there will be some consolidation in the future between the two XAML-based technologies, but that was anticipated long before there was any talk of HTML5 as a viable alternative and is not a result of any policy change due to the existence of HTML5. However, HTML5 is looking, for better or worse, like it will become a major player in cross-platform software development. I suspect that many developers who might otherwise have picked-up Silverlight will choose to learn HTML5 instead. In the long-term, if that becomes a significant trend, then eventually WPF and Silverlight will be phased-out.  However, I don’t see that happening anytime soon. In facet, as I mentioned, I feel the synergy with HTML5 found in these technologies makes them stronger in the short and medium term and they will continue to be players in their various spaces for many years.</p>

    <h3>Programming Jargon Dictionary</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2011-06-20 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011212045/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2349378/new-programming-jargon-you-coined">StackOverflow</a> has a fantastic list of programming terms that have been coined by the development community recently. Some of the best, most appropriate terms are documented below.</p>
<p><strong>Automanually</strong>
Used to refer to a batch job or application that should be scheduled or triggered automatically, but due to unspecified reasons requires manual intervention every time. (not the same as automagically)</p>
<p><strong>Boolean Zen</strong>
The proper practice of using boolean expressions directly without testing for equality to true or false.</p>
<p><strong>Common Law Feature</strong>
A bug in the application that has existed for so long that it is now part of the expected functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster Driven Development</strong>
When Your PMs and salesmen promised that You will build a &quot;space shuttle&quot; in one month.</p>
<p><strong>Egyptian Brackets</strong>
Describes the god-awful c-style where curly-braces are not aligned.</p>
<p><strong>Heisenbug</strong>
An oldie, but still valuable…describes a bug that disappears or changes when put under scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>Higgs-Bugson</strong>
A hypothetical bug predicted to exist based on a small number of possibly related event log entries and other anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Hindenbug</strong>
A catastrophic, data destroying bug.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
A non-inclusive name for a low-level developer (n00b). (note: all non-inclusive language is inappropriate and should not be used)</p>
<p><strong>Nopping</strong>
From the assembler instruction NOP (no operation). Similar to nap but doesn’t imply sleep, just zoning out.</p>
<p><strong>Object Oriented Pasta</strong>
Used to describe spaghetti code wrapped in classes to make it look like an object.</p>
<p><strong>Perl-Grade Obfuscation</strong>
The highest level of code obfuscation possible. Better than passing code through a 1-way hash function.</p>
<p><strong>Refuctoring</strong>
The process of taking a well-designed piece of code and, through a series of small, reversible changes, making it completely unmaintainable by anyone except yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Rubberducking</strong>
The process of talking your own way through a problem, as if talking to a rubber duck.</p>
<p><strong>Scar Tissue</strong>
Any code that is commented out but still included in the current and/or checked-in version.</p>
<p><strong>Smurf Naming Convention</strong>
When almost every class has the same prefix. IE, when a user clicks on the button, a SmurfAccountView passes a SmurfAccountDTO to the SmurfAccountController. The SmurfID is used to fetch a SmurfOrderHistory which is passed to the SmurfHistoryMatch…</p>
<p><strong>Stringly Typed</strong>
One of the antitheses of strongly typed. It describes an implementation that uses strings where more strongly-type options are available.</p>
<p><strong>Try, Catch, Forget</strong>
An empty catch block, no tracing, not even a comment. No attempt to resolve the error and of course the catch block is not at all specific on the exception type.</p>

    <h3>Code Analysis Rules</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2011-06-07 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>FxCop, the built-in code-analysis tool in Visual Studio, is the first thing I check when doing a code review.  If Code Analysis is enabled for a project, setup properly, and its rules have not been overridden, this tool will help maintain consistency in the code, even if that code is worked on by multiple developers.  FxCop also does a good job of identifying if some common mistakes have been made, such as not disposing of an IDisposable object, and can identify things that will help the compiler do its job better, such as ensuring that assemblies which expose public objects identify whether or not they are intended to be CLS compliant.</p>
<p>In order to get these benefits, code analysis must be enabled for each project and a rule set must be selected.  Because adding code-analysis to existing assemblies can be a bit painful, it is recommended that you enable this analysis as soon as a project is created in Visual Studio.  To enable code analysis for an assembly, select the project properties, go to the Code Analysis tab, and check the “Enable Code Analysis on Build (defines CODE_ANALYSIS constant)” box.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/image_2.png" alt="Visual Studio Dialog" /></p>
<p>The default rule set that will be run during code analysis is called “Microsoft Minimum Recommended Rules”.  This is a very small set of rules that is a good one to enable if you are starting to do code analysis on a previously coded assembly.  If however, you are starting clean, I highly recommend starting with either the “Microsoft All Rules” rule set, or your own version of that set, since this rule set will provide the most benefit in all areas of analysis.  To create your own rule sets, select the set you wish to modify and press the “Open” button next to the rule set drop-down.  Once opened, you can make any changes you wish, and use the File –&gt; Save-as menu item to save the rule set with a different file name.  New rule sets will automatically appear in the drop-down menu. You can use the properties tab to update the Name and Description of the set, and the rules editor to enable or disable individual rules.  You can also define, for each rule, whether failures are ignored, result in a warning, or generate a compilation error.  I highly recommend setting all rules that you want to enforce to cause errors since they can always be overridden if necessary but will likely be missed if they only result in warnings.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/image_3.png" alt="Rules List" /></p>
<p>For my projects, I use one of several rule sets that I have set up, all of which are slight modifications to the “Microsoft All Rules” rule set.  I will detail the rule set changes I make and overrides that I allow in each set of circumstances below.  I encourage you to experiment with these rule sets to determine the optimum configuration for your projects.</p>
<h3>All Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modify the “Microsoft All Rules” rule set so that all rules result in an error.  The easiest way to do this is to use the “group by” drop-down to order all rules by “Target Type”.  The only type found here should be “Managed Code”.  With this single group collapsed, use the Action drop-down to select “Error” for all rules.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Entity Framework Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Entity Framework requires navigation properties of entities to be read-write, a violation of rule CA2227, “Collection properties should be read only”.  For projects utilizing the Entity Framework, as well as those designed for use within the entity framework (such as entity POCO libraries), the action of this rule may be set to “Warning” to prevent compilation errors whenever entities with navigation properties are built.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Projects Deployed to Internal Company Servers (and not GAC’ed)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assemblies that will not be deployed to the GAC and will remain on secure, internal servers do not need to have a strong name. Thus, rule CA2210, “Assemblies should have valid strong names”, can be permanently over-ridden or have its action set to “None”.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-Localized Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>For projects that are never to be localized to a foreign culture, you can set the action for rule CA1303, “Do not pass literals as localized parameters”, back to “Warning”.  I find this rule to be especially incorrect when I am writing logging code within my methods (unless using aspect-orientation) because the logging code also serves as functional code-comments if the literals are included in the method calls.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Console Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many console apps ignore the command-line parameters passed-in to the main method, a violation of rule CA1801, “Review Unused Parameters”.  Most of the time, this rule is valuable since you don’t want to have parameters to methods that are never used, however, since we cannot change the parameters to the main method of a console app, but may not wish to use them, this rule can be set to generate a warning in console applications, or can be simply overridden for the parameters to the main method of each console app.  This rule may also be violated temporarily when a method has been stubbed but not yet implemented.  In that case, the rule should be overridden in code similar to rule CA1822 below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other (More Temporary) Modifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rule CA1822, “Mark members as static”, is violated when a method in a class does not use any of the other non-static members of the class.  This is always true when the method has not yet been implemented (is only a stub).  Prior to the method being implemented, this rule should be overridden in code.  The override should be removed from the code once the method has been implemented.</li>
<li>Rule CA1040, “Avoid empty interfaces” is often violated temporarily in TDD/BDD because interfaces may be created without methods and then be built-up as needed by the use-case.  Prior to the interface being defined, this rule should be overridden in code.  The override should be removed from the code once the interface has been defined.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have found using Code Analysis to be a good way to improve the maintainability of my applications, especially when the app is being worked on by multiple members of a project team.  The FxCop tool, built into Visual Studio’s Ultimate and Premium editions, is one of a number of tools and techniques I use to keep my code as maintainable and extensible as possible, resulting in the lowest possible total cost of ownership (TCO).  In future articles, I will explore additional tools and techniques I use for this purpose.</p>

    <h3>Continuous Improvement as a Developer</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2011-04-29 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE">video interview about storytelling</a> for currentTV, Ira Glass, the host of “This American Life”, details the lengthy process that he, and all creative people go through to close the quality gap between the work they are trying to produce, and what they are actually producing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of us who do creative work, we get into it, and we get into it because we have good taste… So you’ve got really good taste and you get into this thing that I don’t even know how to describe but it’s like there’s a gap. That for the first couple of years that you’re making stuff, what you’re making isn’t so good, ok, it’s not that great, it’s really not that great. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not quite that good. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, your taste is still killer. Your taste is still good enough that you can tell that what you’re making is kind of a disappointment to you…you can tell that it’s still sort-of crappy. A lot of people never get past that phase, a lot of people, at that point, they quit. And the thing that I would say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting, creative work, they went through a phase of years where they had really good taste, they could tell that what they were making wasn’t as good as they wanted it to be, they knew it fell short. Some of us can admit that to ourselves and some of us are a little less able to admit that to ourselves. But we knew it didn’t have this special thing we wanted it to have. And the thing I’d say to you is, everybody goes through that, and for you to go through it, if you’re going through it right now, if you’re just getting out of that phase, or if you’re just starting off and you’re entering into that phase, you gotta know, it’s totally normal and the most important possible thing you could do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Ira is specifically talking about TV and radio production, his statements also hold true for more analytic pursuits including software development. There have been many occasions during my career as a developer where I knew that the work I had done did not meet my own lofty expectations. There are a number of reasons for this, several of which I have detailed below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ran out of time/money</strong> – We often take shortcuts while building a solution that we never get back to fixing because we ran out of time or money.  This is sometimes fine, and other times not.  It is important to know when it is acceptable to take shortcuts, and how to be certain to get back to them before they cause problems down the road.</li>
<li><strong>Techniques not yet defined/available</strong> – Often, when new technologies are released, the best practices for using those technologies are not known.  Sometimes, things that are best-practices with older technologies, or older versions of technologies, are no longer the right things to do with the current state-of-affairs.  There are times that you will need to develop those best practices, which can usually only be done through experimentation.</li>
<li><strong>Misunderstanding of best practices</strong> – Sometimes, we simply don’t know or misunderstand the best practices.  Occasionally, we will think we are using the best-known-method for dealing with a problem, only to find that we were mistaken, or misunderstood the problem or the solution.  Either way, we have to choose between fixing the problem through refactoring, scrapping our code and starting over, or accepting the less-than-optimal code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, the solutions to these problems are generally the same as Ira’s, that is, to keep doing it.  Keep building things, refining your skills, and techniques, and bringing in new tools and technologies to continually close the gap between the work you expect to be doing, and the work you are doing.  Continuously refactor your code to improve it, and to search for the best ways of solving the problems we face.  Build light frameworks when appropriate to help solve repeat problems, and keep those frameworks abstract and loosely-coupled enough so that when the technologies change, the solutions can change accordingly.  Finally, and most importantly, never stop learning.  Our industry is one where if you stop, or even slow your learning process, you are very quickly going to be left stuck with antiquated tools and techniques.  Always keep reading new articles and trying new things.  You are unlikely to ever reach the point where you are completely happy with all of your code, but by continuously learning and striving to improve, you can definitely reach the point that you understand your failings and know what you need to do to make things better whenever your work is not what you hoped for.  Then, armed with that knowledge, you have what you need to decide if it is worth it to make the code better, or if is it more valuable to move on to the next thing.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all of the organizers, speakers, sponsors and attendees of <a href="https://apr2011.desertcodecamp.com/">Desert Code Camp 2011.1</a>.  This is the first time that I’ve presented at a Code Camp and it was a fantastic experience for me.  My session, <strong>Building Enterprise Apps using Entity Framework 4</strong>, was very well attended with 35 people cramming, standing-room-only, into a room with a capacity of 28 (please don’t tell the Fire Marshall).  The demos went very well (everything worked as it was supposed to) and the feedback I’ve gotten so far was entirely positive.</p>
<p>I will be posting some additional information from the session shortly, including the sample code and the changes I make to the <strong>Microsoft All Rules</strong> code analysis ruleset, but I wanted to get the session slides up as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If you have any additional feedback on the session, please feel free to <a href="../contact.html">contact me here</a>, in the Fediverse <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a> or by email as shown in the slide deck.</p>

    <h3>Decorating Partial Class Members in C#</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2011-03-08 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Anyone who uses code generation more than trivially in their .NET solutions knows how difficult it is to add metadata to a member of a generated class, even if that class is marked as partial.  Partial classes are terrific for adding members to generated classes, and even allow you to change metadata and other information about the class itself, such as by adding an interface that it implements.  You cannot however, modify an existing member of the class by marking it to not be serialized, or to make it a part of a WCF data contract. I believe, as more and more code is generated by .NET developers using Entity Framework, wsdl.exe and other proxy generation tools, or even T4 directly; we will see a greatly increased need for a workable solution to this problem.</p>
<p>The most common work-around for this problem today is the use of “buddy classes” where a separate class is created to hold the metadata.  A good example of this type of solution can be found in <a href="http://www.asp.net/dynamicdata">ASP.NET Dynamic Data</a>.  However, as you might imagine, this type of implementation has some fairly severe drawbacks.  For one, it requires some sort of mechanism for unifying the functionality of the two classes. An example of this is the case where we have a property on an Entity Framework POCO that should not be serialized when we serialize the rest of the class.  We cannot serialize the POCO correctly unless we use a custom serializer that is aware of the metadata in the buddy class.  We have similar problems if we are trying to use a generated base class as the output of a WCF service.  If the [DataContract] attribute is not already on the generated code (which requires a reference to the System.Runtime.Serialization library) we will have to create a separate object that implements the DataContract to be exposed by the service.  In most cases, this object will be an almost exact duplicate of the state features of the original object, forcing the replication of some code, even if that code is just the properties of the object.</p>
<p>There is a feature that has been proposed in the C# language for some time now that would allow this type of behavior within a single class.  This feature would use the keyword <em><strong>existing</strong></em> to allow the duplication of the definition of partial class members into non-code-generated files so that those members can be decorated with additional metadata without risk of being overwritten when the automatic code is regenerated, and without duplicating the functionality in the member.  Unfortunately, it appears that this feature is not going to make it into the next version of C# and is at risk of not being in the following version as well.  In an email exchange, Mads Torgersen, C# Program Manager at Microsoft, stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…maybe we’re looking at C# next-next-next before the next big set of new feature ads makes it in [to the language].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons (although certainly not the only reason) for this delay, as explained by Mads, is what really struck me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be honest the clamoring for the “existing” feature has died down quite a bit. I think that people are probably resigning to the use of “buddy classes” for this purpose; this seems to be the most common substitute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mads continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…ultimately your feedback is at the basis of how we make these choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I began to wonder, have we really resigned ourselves to using these buddy classes?  Are they less of a problem for others then they are for me?  Am I, perhaps, missing a fairly easy solution to this problem that involves the use of “buddy classes” but solves the issues with that methodology?  Or perhaps, are there other features that we want in the language that are just more important to us than this one?</p>
<p>Please let me know if am I missing something or if there are others out there who feel as I do on this feature request.  If there are many others like me, perhaps we can put our voices together to, as Mads suggests,  let Microsoft know what we need.</p>

    <h3>Entity Framework Associations on Non-Key Fields</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2011-02-03 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Since I have now, for the second time, run into a problem working with Associations on non-key fields in Entity Framework, it is time for me to take a serious look at the issue.</p>
<p>Consider the model below.  There are two entities, a Flight and an Airport.  In this scenario, there are two associations between the entities, Flight.DepartFromAirportId –&gt; Airport.Id and Flight.ArriveAtAirportId –&gt; Airport.Id.  These associations represent the Departure and Arrival airport of the flight.  This model works quite well in Entity Framework 4, making a collection of the arriving and departing flights for each airport available through the navigation properties on the Airport object, and providing a shortcut to the departure and arrival Airport objects for each flight via the navigation properties on the Flight object.</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/Flight%20Airport%20Ok%20ERD.png" alt="Flight Airport Ok ERD" /></p>
<p>The problems I’ve seen occur when the database was designed a bit differently, as is sometimes the case with legacy systems.  Let’s take a look at the second model, below.</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/Flight%20Airport%20Fail%20ERD.png" alt="Flight Airport Fail ERD" /></p>
<p>Here, we have the same basic model, but instead of the DepartFromAirportId and ArriveAtAirportId foreign-keys on the Flight object, we have DepartFrom and ArriveAt fields which link to the IataCode* property of the Airport.</p>
<p>The Airport entity still has the same key property, but the Flight doesn’t use it to establish the association. The current version of the Entity Framework is not capable of supporting associations in this type of model.  If you attempt to establish the association through the designer, you cannot select the proper Principal Key and Dependent Property combination to create the link.  If you manually create the association in the XML code, you will get a compiler error.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, very few of the legacy databases and none of the recently created systems that I work with use this method to create relationships.  However, on the rare occasions that this occurs, it can make life much more complicated. Consider the scenario where I need to get a list of flights that are departing from an airport north of 45 degrees in latitude. In the first model, this is easy using LINQ to Entities.</p>
<pre><code>var flights = context.Flights.Where(f =&gt; f.DepartureAirport.Latitude &gt; 45);
</code></pre>
<p>However, with the second model, since there is no association between the entities, there are no navigation properties that can be followed.  Thus the join has to be done in the LINQ to Entities query, making the syntax much more complex.</p>
<pre><code>var flights = context.Flights.Where(
   f =&gt; context.Airports.Where(a =&gt; a.Latitude &gt; 45) 
   .Contains(context.Airports.Where(a =&gt; a.IataCode == f.DepartFrom)
   .FirstOrDefault()));
</code></pre>
<p>This query finds the flights where the collection of airports with latitude &gt; 45 degrees contains the one airport that has the IataCode matching the flight’s DepartFrom field.  As you can see, this query is much more difficult to create and maintain then the one which simply uses the Entity Framework provided navigation property.</p>
<p>There is another solution, but I hate to even mention it since I believe it is likely to cause far more problems down the road then it solves now.  That solution, is to manually edit the storage model to fool the Entity Framework into thinking that the properties you wish to use for the association are actually the primary key fields.  Of course, were you to make these changes, then later refresh your model from the database, all of the changes would be lost and you would have to start over.  While this might not seem like such a horrible thing, remember that it might not be you making those changes, or worse, it is you having to deal with an unworkable model left to you by someone else.</p>
<p>* The Iata Code for an airport is the 3-character code used on your luggage and tickets – PHX, CLT, LAX, ORD, etc.</p>

    <h3>Two Things I Learned on Pex4Fun.com Today</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2010-11-12 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Since I’m a fan of puzzles, I’ve been spending a bit of time on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101112142013/http://www.pexforfun.com/">PexForFun.com</a> lately.  This site was put together by the Pex team (part of Microsoft Research) to show off the capabilities of some of the research group’s  latest creations; Pex, Moles, and Code Contracts.  I’ve been enjoying this site because it gives me the opportunity to solve some coding puzzles, while at the same time discovering things about these new tools.  Today alone, I discovered the following:</p>
<h2>The order of Contract.Requires() in Code Contracts matters.</h2>
<p>Though it doesn’t seem like it should matter (at least to me), the order that code contracts are specified does seem to matter at execution, at least in some circumstances, if runtime checking is enabled.  For example, in my <em>ChallengeAuction</em> code duel there is a practical limit to how many bids may be supplied since Pex has to test each of the data elements.  Defining this limit in as a Contract.Requires() element works well as long as that statement is placed before a statement testing the data elements, such as one verifying that the key for each bid is not an empty string.  Reversing the order of these contract statements causes the test to occur for each data element of the dictionary, and a “path bounds exceeded” error to be generated by Pex.</p>
<h2>Pex doesn’t generate more than 1 Dictionary value for any test dataset.</h2>
<p>The same code duel, <em>ChallengeAuction</em> pointed out to me that apparently, Pex only generates 1 data element in a dictionary.  That is, in the <em>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</em> defined for bids in the code duel, Pex generates a Dictionary object of various sizes, but only supplies 1 data element within the Dictionary.  This means that a number of code paths are not being verified since it is important in this duel to test whether or not the highest bid wins the auction.  If you try the duel, you could actually fool Pex into thinking you have a successful solution even with a method that returns the lowest or first bids as the winning bid.</p>
<p>I have posted this as a question on the <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/72927f79-05e7-4bdf-836c-25238ffd7192/pex-doesnt-generate-more-than-1-dictionary-value?forum=pex">Pex and Moles PowerTool</a> forum and have yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101112142013/http://www.pexforfun.com/">PexForFun.com</a>. Try a few code duels and perhaps create a few of your own.  I have created several code duels which you are welcome to try and solve:</p>

    <p>I will be speaking at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100512033945/http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/developer-ignite/">Developer Ignite</a> event in Chandler on July 22nd.  The topic of my talk will be &quot;Simplicity Through Abstraction&quot; during which I will be giving a very high-level overview of using Dependency Injection as an Inversion-of-Control methodology to create simplicity in software architecture.</p>
<p>While putting my presentation together I have found a number of items that I wanted to include in my presentation, but simply can't due to the obvious constraints of a 5-minute presentation.  Some of these items won't even get a mention, others will be mentioned only in passing.  I include them here as a list of topics for me to discuss in future posts to this blog.  Hopefully this will occur, at least in part, prior to the ignite event so that there will be a set of resources available to those at the event who were previously unfamiliar with these techniques and wish to explore them further.</p>
<p>These topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IoC Containers</li>
<li>Dealing with Provider-Specific requirements</li>
<li>Configuration as a dependency</li>
<li>Local providers for external dependencies</li>
<li>Providers as application tiers</li>
<li>Testing at the provider level</li>
<li>Top Down Design [Added: 7/12/2009]</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a topic that you are particularly interested in, or have any questions about IoC, Dependency Injection, or Providers that you would like me to answer, please use the comments or contact me <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>

    <h3>Oracle String SQL Query using a DateTime from C#</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2009-03-07 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>The following statement builds a C# string containing an Oracle SQL query that uses a DateTime specified in the .NET code.  It uses the Oracle TO_DATE function to convert the string date to an oracle date object and specifies the format of the string date for both the C# output and the Oracle input. Using this statement, there can never be a date format mismatch since the same format is specified at both ends.</p>
<p>string sql = string.Format(&quot;select * from MyDB.MyTable t where t.MyDate &gt; <br />
     TO_DATE('{0:MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm}', 'MM/dd/yyyy HH24:mi')&quot;, DateTime.Now);</p>
<p>I have found myself using this type of statement fairly often to create tools that help me do my job.  For what it's worth, I wouldn't put this type of code in production since you rarely want to execute a query from a string in a production environment.</p>

    <h3>Use System.DateTimeOffset To Better Handle Time Zones</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2008-12-25 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>In his post, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151024033950/https://weblogs.asp.net/okloeten/6795009">The Death of System.DateTime?</a> Omer van Kloeten evaluates the use of the System.DateTimeOffset object in place of System.DateTime to improve handling of Time Zone sensitive times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When representing a date/time, especially in an internationally-faced system, you have to include a time-zone. DateTime did a very poor job handling time-zones, like being insensitive to changes. DateTimeOffset is the exact same thing as DateTime, only it takes heed of time-zones. For instance, comparing two DateTimeOffsets with the same UTC time in different time-zones will result in equality.</p>
<p>Moreover, DateTime also had only three modes: Local, UTC and Unspecified, whereas DateTimeOffset has an Offset property, allowing you to create dates in any time-zone you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not yet experimented with the System.DateTimeOffset type but what Omer says makes a lot of sense to me.  Has anyone else played with this object?</p>

    <p>Joe Guadagno has posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://weblogs.asp.net/jguadagno/archive/2008/12/11/the-best-of-pdc-in-phx.aspx">his summary of The Best of PDC in PHX</a>. This was a great event and I want to make sure those who put it together, spoke, and sponsored it know we are tremendously appreciative of their efforts.  This includes: <a href="https://www.josephguadagno.net/">Joseph Guadagno</a>, <a href="https://www.scottcate.com/">Scott Cate</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/bags/">Rob Bagby</a> as well as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rht.com/">Robert Half Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.teksystems.com/">TekSystems</a> and <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>.</p>

    <h3>PDC 2008 - Day 2</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2008-11-01 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: event" class="small" href="../Search/event.html">event</a>&nbsp;<a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Day 2 was a more focused day for me at PDC 2008. After attending the morning keynotes, which included the first peeks at Windows 7 features as well as a terrific (as always) code-only presentation on programming against the cloud by Don Box and Chris Anderson, I headed over to the hands-on-labs where I spent the rest of the day working with Azure and creating applications that run in the cloud. I also received my Azure key and began the process of setting up a virtual machine to house the Azure tools.</p>
<h3>Real-Time Updates on Twitter</h3>
<p>Just a reminder that much of what is happening here at the PDC is being posted in real-time (or close to it) on Twitter. My Twitter updates can be found <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@Bsstahl">@bsstahl@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>
<h3>Keynotes</h3>
<p>Day 2 keynotes focused on the client side of Windows development. Not surprisingly, this included Windows 7 and WPF development improvements as well as Silverlight and ASP.NET development. Some things that caught my attention in the keynotes included features of Windows 7 like its ability to &quot;live&quot; on a domain, but still participate in a &quot;Home Group&quot; when your work laptop is brought home.  Multi-monitor support also looks to be vastly improved including the ability to work multi-monitor in a remote desktop session. Scott Guthrie also introduced a number of new controls and tools for developing applications in WPF and Silverlight including a Ribbon control that appears intended to make your WPF apps look like Windows Forms apps.</p>

<p>The 2nd Keynote of the day was Don Box and Chris Anderson's fantastic presentation on developing applications that bring cloud computing into the enterprise. Clearly the most engaging of all of the Microsoft speakers, this duo put together, over the course of the 1.5 hour session, a series of services that ran both in the cloud and within the firewall, and linked the two securely, but in real-time.  You would not be wasting your time if you were to view the video of this keynote online.</p>
<h3>Hands-On Labs</h3>
<p>The remainder of my day, after lunch, was spent in the hands-on labs working through the prescriptive samples provided by Microsoft for their Azure product. I was able to complete the first two of these labs which detailed the process of creating websites and services in the cloud that used local-storage and queues to perform a number of relatively simple tasks. These labs clearly answered my question from yesterday morning, with the answer that I expected. That is, an Azure &quot;Web Role&quot; is a web page or SOAP service that runs in the cloud. As such, everything (that I can think of) that I might need to run on my own servers, can be outsourced into the cloud, to provide the availability of virtually unlimited scale with amazing reliability. The still-unanswered question here is price, but since the CTP is free, I will continue to move in this direction until I find a reason to change course.</p>
<h3>Day 3 Preview</h3>
<p>Day 3 looks to be futures day, with the keynote focusing on Microsoft Research properties and technologies. Watch Twitter for all the action as it occurs.</p>

    <h3>Multiple Inheritance - Its Time Should Come Again Soon</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2008-06-16 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Over the last few years I've heard a number of public statements from developers about the lack of need for multiple implementation inheritance in .NET and other modern development platforms. Their logic often seems to imply that if you need multiple implementation inheritance, you are not designing your applications properly.  While admittedly, there are usually work-arounds (such as interface inheritance) that allow us to simulate this feature, they usually require that portions of our code are duplicated, violating the Agile requirement &quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&quot;.</p>
<p>One commonly seen example of where multiple implementation inheritance would be very valuable is in multi-tiered, domain specific applications, especially in the data-tier where we may wish to have more-than-one implementation to support multiple data-stores.  Think about the typical data-tier scenario. In this scenario we have a set of domain objects, based on an inherited set of entities with common properties and methods that represent a physical object in the problem domain. These objects also have a commonality in that they are implementations of an object-type common to that data store and may have properties and methods relating specifically to the storage of data.  So, an object whose responsibility it is to persist an Employee entity to a SQL Server data store, could inherit from both our domain Employee entity, and our SQL Data Storage object.  If we also had an implementation that stored data in XML format, we might have an object that inherits both from the same Employee entity as well as from the XMLNode object. If multiple implementation inheritance were supported in our framework, we could avoid the common work-around of repeating our entity implementation by using an interface to simulate that inheritance, or by simply repeating our data persistence logic in each object.</p>
<p>I certainly understand the need to ship a product.  Since I am also well aware of the added complexity that multiple implementation inheritance creates in compilers and frameworks, it is easy for me to imagine why this feature did not make it into either of the first two major revs of Microsoft's Common Language Runtime.  It is my opinion however that, with the third major release of the CLR forthcoming (Rev 3s being where Microsoft traditionally &quot;nails it&quot;) they should strongly consider adding support for multiple implementation inheritance.</p>

    <h3>Encapsulation and Generic Lists</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2007-09-16 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>It has often been said that each new language feature gives programmers more rope with which to hang themselves. Unfortunately, what it really seems like is that each feature gives other programmers more rope with which to hang me, or you, or whomever the next poor schmuck is who has to deal with their code. Back in the relatively early days of .NET 2.0, I wrote about <a href="../Posts/Generics-Concerns.html">some concerns I had with Generics</a>. It has turned out that Generics are everything I could have hoped for in a language feature, and everything I feared.</p>
<p>Generics are an outstanding way of dealing with a number of issues in a very elegant, but also type-safe way. Among many things, this includes collections. I see no reason why there should be any new collections created that are not based on Generics and it is my understanding that System.Collections.CollectionBase (the non-Generic base collection class) is to be deprecated sometime in the near future. However, as I feared over a year ago, there are many that miss the point somewhat and expose List&lt;t&gt; on their interfaces. The Generic List object is a very powerful and easy to use collection, but it is not extensible. If you write code that exposes List&lt;t&gt;, you are effectively passing a strongly-typed array-list. Doing this breaks encapsulation because any code we write against that list, has to be repeated everywhere we want to perform that operation.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a calendar object that exposes a list of events that we want to reserve. We often see this code:</p>
<pre><code>  List&lt;CalendarEvent&gt; calendarEvents = Calendar.Events;  
  for each (CalendarEvent evt in calendarEvents)  
      evt.Reserve();
</code></pre>
<p>rather than the far preferable:</p>
<pre><code>  CalendarEventsCollection calendarEvents = Calendar.Events;  
  calendarEvents.Reserve();
</code></pre>
<p>where the CalendarEventsCollection object contains:</p>
<pre><code>  public void Reserve()  
   {  
       for each (CalendarEvent evt in this)  
           evt.Reserve();   
   }
</code></pre>
<p>or even better:</p>
<pre><code>  Calendar.ReserveEvents();
</code></pre>
<p>where the Calendar object contains:</p>
<pre><code>  private CalendarEventsCollection _calendarEvents;  
  public CalendarEventsCollection Events  
    { return _calendarEvents; }  
  
   public void ReserveEvents()  
   {  
       this.Events.Reserve();  
   }
</code></pre>
<p>The latter being preferable because all of the functionality we want to expose is completely encapsulated in the appropriate object and doesn't have to be repeated wherever it is needed. Of course, we can't do this if we are lobbing around <em>List<T></em> instead of collection objects that derive from <em>System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection</em>.</p>
<p>While the improper use of <em>List<T></em> may not be exactly the &quot;House of Sticks&quot; that I feared in early 2006, it is an item where proper use is not necessarily obvious and which has been misunderstood by many very good programmers.  Please, encourage all developers to practice proper encapsulation by deriving collection classes from one of the Generic collection implementations.</p>

    <h3>Unit Testing the Data Tier</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2007-08-23 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Recently, both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906034419/http://codebetter.com/jefferypalermo/2007/06/29/levels-of-automated-testing-within-a-single-application/">Jeffrey Polermo</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906034419/http://codebetter.com/jefferypalermo/2007/06/29/levels-of-automated-testing-within-a-single-application/">Scott Bellware</a> have written posts on <em>codebetter.com</em> positing that testing the Database should be avoided when doing unit testing. Specifically, Polermo points out that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unit testing, by common definition, excludes external dependencies. It's not a unit test if we reach out and touch things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this may be a nice ideal, in reality it simply does not turn out to be the best way to do things in the majority of situations. Of course, to be fair, every situation is different and I'm sure there are many circumstances where it is better to pull-out database testing into integration tests or similar. In fact, there are perfectly valid reasons why we might not want to call it a unit-test if we test the database. However, for the majority of software projects (i.e. the 80% use-case), I belive it is not only legitimate, but best-practice, to test the database with our unit tests.</p>
<p>To understand the primary reasoning here, we need to go back to the fundamentals and look at our logical view of this 80% use-case software system.</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/SoftwareSystemLogicalView_small.png" alt="Logical View of a Typical 3-Tiered Software System" /></p>
<p>The drawing illustrates many of the systems we create today in .NET. Of course, not all systems will fit into this model, but it certainly represents the classic 3-tier architecture used by so many of our projects. As this drawing shows, our data-access objects, which are often just thin wrappers over stored procedures, perhaps containing some ORM logic, are really part of the data-services layer. Even though these objects may physically reside alongside the business-layer objects, they really belong to the data-services. Thus, the assertion that we cross boundaries by testing the database when we test the data-services &quot;unit&quot; is not, in my mind, a valid concern. Yes, the tests will make out-of-process calls in getting to the database, and we will suffer a performance penalty as a result, but the fact remains that the database is not a dependency of the data-access objects, it is an integral part of that layer. Thus, in order to test that layer, we must test the database.</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, this view of the application works out best in terms of testing it since the data-access objects are generally so thin. What is the point of testing those objects in isolation since they are basically wrappers most of the time? It is sometimes appropriate to write some tests for these objects on their own if they contain ORM type logic that can be tested as a unit, but for the most part, when we test the data-layer, what we want to test is that the proper data is returned. Validating that the proper data is returned from the data-tier requires testing the entire layer, including the database. Another factor here is that the database itself cannot generally be tested without some form of .NET object interface. As an example, if we were to try and write a unit test for a stored procedure in nUnit or VS Team System, we would need to have the same data-access code in our test, as we have in our data-tier object. Thus, it only makes sense to test those items as one unit. Perhaps down the road, since SQL server now has its own CLR, we may be able to do more testing of the database objects at that level and not need data-access objects. When that occurs, we should definately revisit our best-practices. But for now it is clear that the best way to test data-access is to test the data-services layer as a unit.</p>
<p>Please do not think that in any way I am suggesting we need to test the database in the same tests that are used for the business-layer objects. That would be a clear violation of the separation-of-concerns discussed by both Polermo and Bellware as well as many others and would best be described as an integration test because it crosses the boundaries in the diagram above. We should definately isolate the layers of our applications from each other in order to accurately test them. What I am saying is that the isolation of the data-tier should occur between the business-tier and the data-tier on the diagram. Thus, testing of the data-access objects includes testing of the database objects. The question then really becomes, how do we unit-test the data-services layer so that the tests execute as quickly as possible, do not have dependancies on existing data so that changes to the data cause tests to fail, yet still accurately and completely test that unit. I am attempting to put together a list of best-practices in this area and will make that the subject of a future post.</p>

    <h3>.NET Open-Source Projects</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2007-07-14 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I had the satisfaction today of doing something I hadn't done in quite a while; that is, to submit a patch to an open-source project and have it accepted and merged into the code-base.  It wasn't an earth-shattering bug or a fix to an application that will help save humanity, just a fairly easy fix to a bug in an asynchronous activity that occurs after posting a blog entry in <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.net</a>.  The part that I had forgotten about open-source projects was just how satisfying it is to contribute to a project that will benefit the community.  That, in combination with the fact that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000904.html">Jeff Atwood of CodingHorror.com</a> has created <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pKxDW35algYebfs8nssTjIQ">a list of potentially worthy .NET open-source projects</a> (he will be contributing some cash to one or more of them in the near future) has reminded me of how much everyone benefits from these projects.  I won't bore you with another discussion of why and how open-source projects help everyone, I just felt that I should post a link to Jeff's list of projects and encourage everyone to take a look at the list and see if there is any project there that grabs your attention.  If so, please consider contributing some of your time and skills to that project.</p>

    <h3>10 Common ASP.NET Pitfalls</h3>

    <p>Another MSDN back-article that I found interesting was <a href="../Files/MSDNMag-WebAppFollies-200607.pdf">Web App Follies</a> from the July 2006 issues, where Jeff Prosise reviews what, from his experience, are 10 common ASP.NET gotchas.  Most of these items are fairly well understood, but I think we all have our specializations and can use any valuable tips/tricks we can find.  I, for example, rarely come in contact with User Controls.  I create Custom Controls when needed because I prefer the lifecycle and reuse benefits over those of User Controls.  So for me, the 1st tip that Jeff gives us about Output Caching User Controls could be very valuable the next time I am debugging an app created by others who have used User Controls.  My guess is that everyone will find out something new looking through this piece.</p>

    <h3>Unit Test "Normalization"</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2007-07-07 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>In a recent conversation about Unit Tests, I was asked about how many asserts I would put into a single test, since some feel that there should only be one Assert per test. My answer was, that I look at it like database normalization with the test name serving as the primary key; that is, the asserts in the test should relate directly and only to that key. This analogy is also appropriate because DB normalization is a good thing within reason, but can definately be overdone. Unit test &quot;normalization&quot; can also be overdone if we try to break-out each assert into its own test.</p>
<p>An example of where multiple asserts might be put into one test is a test of the Add method of a collection object which inherits from System.Collection.CollectionBase. When an item is added, it is appropriate to test for the proper index of that item to be returned from the method, as well as to test that the collection is holding the correct number of items after the Add is done. Both tests relate directly to the Add method. An argument could be made that the count of items relates to the Count property of the collection and therefore that assert doesn't relate only to the Add method, but since we are usually not coding the count property (because it was coded for us in CollectionBase), we don't need to test the Count property on its own, and it should be tested as part of the Add test.</p>

    <p>I recently stumbled across an interesting item in a back-issue of MSDN Magazine. The article, <a href="..//Files/MSDNMag-CLRInsideOut-200602.pdf">&quot;Improving Application Startup Time&quot; by Claudio Caldato</a>, appeared in the CLR Inside Out segment in February 2006. While discussing strong-named assemblies, Claudio recommended adding them to the GAC for performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an assembly is not installed in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC), you will pay the cost of hash verification of strong-named assemblies along with native code generation (NGEN) image validation if a native image for that assembly is available in the machine. In other words, if an assembly is strong named, the CLR will ensure the integrity of the assembly binary by verifying that the cryptographic hash of the assembly matches the one in the assembly manifest. But if the assembly is in the GAC, this verification can be skipped because the verification is performed as part of installation into the GAC and any update requires administrative permissions. So the CLR is basically assured that changes have not occurred.</p>
<p>The hash verification process is expensive because it involves touching every page in the assembly, which can be bad for cold startup. Also, the hash computation is CPU-intensive and thus impacts warm startup, too. The extent of the impact depends on the size of the assembly being verified.</p>
<p>If an assembly has been precompiled using NGEN but it is not installed in the GAC, then during binding, fusion needs to verify that the native image and the MSIL assembly are the same version (to avoid cases where a newer version of the assembly is deployed on the machine but a newer version of the native image is not generated). In order to accomplish that, the CLR needs to access pages in the MSIL assembly, which can hurt cold startup time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this particularly interesting because I generally do not recommend putting assemblies into the GAC unless there is a particular need. The GAC is a very useful and powerful tool, but it does add complexity to the deployment of applications, occasionally limiting the frequency with which applications can be deployed, and often increasing the testing requirements for deployment of applications that use shared assemblies. As a result, I usually avoid putting assemblies in the GAC unless they truly need to be there (such as shared .dlls in applications that require that they be using the same version of the assembly). I have also heard of people pulling assemblies that were installed in the GAC, back out into bin-folder type deployments in order to simplify the deployment process.</p>
<p>The information from this article adds a wrinkle to the process of removing assemblies from the GAC because it makes the best-practice for doing so include the removal of the strong-name (which was required for inclusion in the GAC). As a result, there may be a performance penalty incurred at each application startup for these apps if the strong-name is left in place. Since removal of the strong-name will not always be possible, this is certainly something to consider. While I doubt that this could cause enough of a performance decrease by itself to make it worth keeping assemblies in the GAC that would otherwise be removed, it is a fact worth knowing, and more importantly, worth testing when considering such a move.</p>

    <h3>Testing Properties with Inconsistent Accessibility</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2007-06-26 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I ran into an interesting problem today while attempting to test a property member which had a <strong>public</strong> getter, but an <strong>internal</strong> setter (a .NET 2.0 construction in C#).</p>
<p>Consider the following class:</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/TestClass.png" alt="Class Definition" /></p>
<p>This class features an internal constructor, along with a private field (_id) which is exposed by a property (ID) that is read-only on the public interface, but read-write internally to the assembly. This class looks as shown below in Reflector. Notice that the ID property is recognized as having a <strong>public</strong> getter, but the setter is marked as <strong>internal</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/TestClass%20In%20Reflector.png" alt="Class in Reflector" /></p>
<p><img src="..//Images/TestClass%20ID%20Property%20in%20Reflector.png" alt="Class in Reflector" /></p>
<p>Using the Visual Studio 2005 test generator (right-click on the class and select Create Unit Test), I get the following:</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/IDTest_AsGenerated.png" alt="Test Method - As Generated" /></p>
<p>The problem is, this test will not work (notice the blue squiggly). The error is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Property or indexer 'TestClass.ID' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that the code-generator only looks at the primary property scope delaration, that it is <strong>public</strong>, and ignores the <strong>internal</strong> qualifier on the setter. As a result, the code-generated accessor for the object does not contain an accessor for the ID property, and the generated test will not compile since the property is, in fact, settable only internal to the assembly.</p>
<p>The work-around here is actually quite simple, that is to do within the test what the code-generated accessor object normally does for us:</p>
<p><img src="..//Images/IDTest_Workaround.png" alt="Test Method - Workaround" /></p>
<p>I figure that Microsoft knows about this problem by now, but I couldn't find anything about it on the net. I may not have been searching using the appropriate terminology. I'll send Scott Guthrie a note just in case. If you are aware of another way around this problem, or if you know of a way to get the code-generator to act properly under these conditions, I would be very interested to hear about it.</p>

    <h3>Owning Code is Evil</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2007-06-14 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Commenting on a <a href="http://www.skrenta.com/2007/05/code_is_our_enemy.html">Rich Skrenta</a> post, the point of which is that we should write as little code as possible, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000878.html">Jeff Atwood</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I couldn't agree more. I've given similar advice when I exhorted developers to Code Smaller. And I'm not talking about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> contest where we use up all the clever tricks in our books to make the code fit into less physical space. I'm talking about practical, sensible strategies to reduce the volume of code an individual programmer has to read to understand how a program works. Here's a trivial little example of what I'm talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>if (s == String.Empty)</li>
<li>if (s == &quot;&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems obvious to me that the latter case is better because it's just plain smaller. And yet I'm virtually guaranteed to encounter developers who will fight me, almost literally to the death, because they're absolutely convinced that the verbosity of String.Empty is somehow friendlier to the compiler. As if I care about that. As if anyone cared about that!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I certainly agree that we should endeavor to write as little code as we can, for all of the reasons spelled out in Rich’s post. The example that Jeff gives is however, in my opinion, totally contrary to the true intent. While he is correct that nobody should care about whether or not code is better for the compiler, String.Empty is generally better to use than double-quotes because it is explicit, and therefore much easier for a human to read. There can be no doubt what String.Empty means, and there can be no doubt about what value it holds. While most editors/compilers eliminate the worry about control characters between double-quotes, there is no easy way to be sure, especially if you are viewing the code in notepad. As a result, we are generally better off typing the few extra characters. Remember that the goals is to create code that is easier (and therefore cheaper) to create, edit and maintain. Saving a few typed characters here and there does not help achieve that goal, it is simplicity of the code that does. Since one of the key factors in achieving simplicity is clarity, we should do whatever we can to make our code as clear and explicit as possible. This usually includes things like avoiding the use of default values, even though explicitly defining those values will cost us extra keystrokes.</p>
<p>Far more important in terms of code-reduction than saving keystrokes is avoiding owning code that someone else, usually Microsoft, is willing to own for us. I don't know how many times I have seen developers create their own serialization mechanism when .NET serialization would have worked fine, or create their own collection implementation from scratch rather than inheriting from System.Collections.CollectionBase. Please don’t misunderstand me; there are times when it is appropriate to do these things, if the canned mechanisms truly won’t work for the use-case. If these already-existing frameworks will work however, it is imperative that we allow Microsoft to own that code, and allow the thousands of other .NET developers out there to test it for us.</p>

    <h3>Profile Provider Exception</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2006-10-07 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>While working on a custom Profile provider, I needed to set the values in a SettingPropertyValuesCollection object to pass to the SetPropertyValues method of the provider. Using the code below, I was always getting a NullReferenceException when the provider attempted to read the values out of the collection.</p>
<p>Dim objProperties As New System.Configuration.SettingsPropertyValueCollection<br />
Dim objProperty As New System.Configuration.SettingsProperty&quot;BirthDate&quot;)<br />
objProperty.PropertyValue = #2/14/2004#<br />
Dim objPropertyValue As New System.Configuration.SettingsPropertyValue(objProperty)<br />
objProperties.Add(objPropertyValue)</p>
<p>The problem occurs because the collection doesn't know what type to assign the value to coming out of the collection. By modifying the code as follows, I specify the type of the property, and the process executes as expected.</p>
<p>Dim objProperties As New System.Configuration.SettingsPropertyValueCollection<br />
Dim objProperty As New System.Configuration.SettingsProperty(&quot;BirthDate&quot;)<br />
objProperty.PropertyValue = #2/14/2004#<br />
objProperty.PropertyType = GetType(System.DateTime)<br />
Dim objPropertyValue As New System.Configuration.SettingsPropertyValue(objProperty)<br />
objProperties.Add(objPropertyValue)</p>

    <h3>Solving DataSet Constraint Problems</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2006-08-31 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Roy Osherove, and one of his commenters on <a href="https://osherove.com/blog/">his blog</a>, explains how to find out the source of a constraint problem in a DataSet. To do so, simply set the <strong>DataSet.EnforceConstraints</strong> property to false, then load your data. Once everything is loaded, set the <strong>EnforceConstraints</strong> property back to True, while trapping for the error. Once the error occurs, you can iterate through the Tables, testing the <strong>HasErrors</strong> property. For each table with errors, iterate through its rows testing the same property. Rows that have errors will have a property called <strong>RowError</strong> that describes the specific problem with that row.</p>
<p>Roy's original article is: <a href="https://osherove.com/blog/2004/10/3/dataset-hell-failed-to-enable-constraints-one-or-more-rows-c.html?rq=DataSet%20hell%20-%20%22Failed%20to%20enable%20constraints">DataSet hell - &quot;Failed to enable constraints.

    <h3>XSL vs. Regular Expressions</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2006-05-21 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I had an interesting discussion today with a colleague on the use of XSL vs. Regular Expressions. During the course of the conversation, I broke the process of translation down into 3 steps; pattern recognition, data interpretation, and data mapping. XSL excels at all 3 of these tasks, while Regular Expressions can do all 3, but excels primarily at pattern recognition. The result of the conversation was that Regular Expressions should be used in situations where only pattern recognition needs to be done, such as in data validation (i.e. does this string look like an email address) and would be excellent for when only 1 item of data needs to be interpreted (i.e. Grab the email address from this string and do something with it). When multiple data items need to be interpreted and mapped, then XSL is clearly the better choice. Also, XSL is almost always the proper solution when the data is in XML format and is to stay in XML format.</p>

There was simply too much information to try and summarize it here, but suffice it to say that, when used in the proper way, Atlas appears to be a strong model for UI development that is consistant with the way we currently do development. It may even help to extend the boundaries of where and why it is appropriate to use client-side JavaScript.</p>

    <p>A number of new facts came out of the final talk I attended on the day, Mickey Williams' discussion of ASP.NET 2.0 custom controls. These key facts for me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded resources can be used in 2.0 controls (i.e. graphics)</li>
<li>ControlState can be used for critical data rather than ViewState. ControlState can't be turned off (be sure to use this for good and not for evil)</li>
<li>SmartTags can be easily created to expose the most common elements of a control to the page developer for easy modification and configuration</li>
<li>Controls can now inherit from CompositeControl or CompositeDataBoundControl</li>
<li>Mickey highly reccomends <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector</a> as a class browser, explorer, analyzer and documentation viewer for .NET</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure the slide-decks and samples will be posted soon.</p>

    <p>Rob Bagby continued his outstanding presentations with not just an overview of the Exception Handling Block, but a full-blown strategy for handling exceptions. Rob had 5 goals for the session which I have paraphrased below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand when and why to catch an exception To Recover from the error (or attempt to) To Add Context To Clean up (close connections, etc) To Log or Notify To hide the details of an exception</li>
<li>Understand the categories of exceptions Business Technical Security</li>
<li>Understand what is truly an exception Don't use exceptions for flow-control</li>
<li>Understand Exception Propogation Options Automatic Propogation (bubbling) Catch &amp; Rethrow Clean Resolve LogCatch, Wrap &amp; Throw Wrapped</li>
<li>Understand Custom Exceptions and When to Use Them
when an appropriate exception doesn't already exist To add discreet handling To add a specific behavior or information</li>
</ol>
<p>Rob went into quite a few specifics on exactly how this information could be utilized which is in the slide decks that I will link to asap.</p>
<p>This session got my vote as the most useful session of the day. Thanks Rob!</p>

    <h3>T-SQL 2005</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2006-05-08 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>The first session I attended was T-SQL 2005 Enhancements, Tricks and Tips. David Lundell was the instructor and did a nice job.</p>
<p>Some key points were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Table Expression (CTE) - A way to alias a query for use within another query. This can also be used to execute queries recursively.</li>
<li>nTile - Allows a resultset to be &quot;partitioned&quot; into segments. i.e. 100 segments make it a percentile, 4 segments is a quartile, etc.</li>
<li>Rank - Similar to nTile except the values are ranked in order. If two or more items tie for a rank, subsequent ranks are skipped. That is, if two items are tied for first, the next item would have a rank of 3.</li>
<li>Dense_Rank - Same as Rank only no ranks are skipped, regardless of ties</li>
<li>Row_Number - Same as Dense_Rank only with no duplicates, just lists the items in order from 1..n. Ties are arbitrarily broken and consistant order by broken ties is not guaranteed.</li>
<li>Pivot - Allows the creation of Pivot Tables but in my opinion, won't be very useful until we can set the columns dynamically. Currently in SQL 2005 the Pivot columns have to be explicitly defined.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Introduction to Agile/Extreme Programming</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2006-05-08 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: event" class="small" href="../Search/event.html">event</a>&nbsp;<a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>This session was given by Josh Knowles who gave a good overview of Agile methodologies. There wasn't much new for me here, but Josh did give some good selling-points for these types of methods, and did solidify a few concepts for me. Primarily, the keys to Agile development are as Josh described them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals &amp; Interactions over Process and Tools</li>
<li>Working Software over Documentation</li>
<li>Constant Collaboration</li>
<li>The ability to respond to change rapidly</li>
</ul>
<p>Some ways to accomplish these things include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short release cycles (i.e. Quarterly)</li>
<li>Refactoring - Don't Repeat Yourself</li>
<li>&quot;Spike&quot; unknowns - Reduce Second-Order Ignorance</li>
<li>Stories should be told on Note Cards - Keep 'em Short</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tools at our disposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>nAnt - An automated build tool</li>
<li>CruiseControl.net - An integration tool</li>
<li>Subversion - A freeware Source-Control System that Josh likes better than VSS</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll post links to some of these slide-decks as I get them.</p>

    <h3>Generics Concerns</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2006-04-29 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Another feature that concerns me (see my <a href="../Posts/NET-20-Concerns.html">earlier post</a>) is .NET Generics. While it is nice to be able to specify a strongly-typed collection without having to create a class, it seems to me like this is still the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa716279%28VS.60%29.aspx">house of sticks</a>, rather than the house of bricks we really want. Also, extensibility seems to suffer in this model because we are limiting our encapsulation. I certainly have not used this enough to say one way or another for certain, I just currently have concerns.</p>

    <h3>.NET 2.0 Concerns</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2006-04-29 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>I am seeing some things in .NET 2.0 that concern me. Much of it has to do with Microsoft putting in features that have obviously been demanded by many developers, but were not included in earlier versions of the framework because, for the most part, they are the wrong thing to do the majority of the time. For example, Microsoft has included the ability to have inline code as well as the standard code-behind model in ASP.NET 2.0 pages. While this seems like a nice feature, I can't come up with a good reason to ever mix my object code and HTML code. Perhaps someone else can. If you do, please let me know.</p>

    <h3>Dictionary of PDC ‘03 Terms</h3>
    <h5>Posted by bsstahl on 2003-11-02 and Filed Under: <a title="Category: event" class="small" href="../Search/event.html">event</a>&nbsp;<a title="Category: development" class="small" href="../Search/development.html">development</a>&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>Instead of posting a summary of the last 2 days of the PDC, I decided to summarize the entire PDC as best I can by creating a glossary of terms. These terms came out of the PDC as either new, having a modified meaning, or greater importance than before.</p>
<p><strong>WinFX</strong> – The code-name for the next generation of the .NET Framework. Key features of WinFX include <em>Indigo</em>, <em>Avalon</em> and <em>WinFS</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Longhorn</strong> – The code-name for the next generation of Windows built on, and to work with, <em>WinFX</em>. Longhorn provides the user interface features of <em>Avalon</em>, the file-system improvements of <em>WinFS</em>, and the service support of <em>Indigo</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Indigo</strong> – The code-name for a set of managed services in the .NET Framework created to support a unified coding structure for applications developed using the services model. In a very-real sense, Indigo makes the SOAP implementation available to all types of services, not just web services and unifies the three main development standards for architecting solutions using the services model, Web Services, .NET Remoting, and Enterprise Services, under one set of managed objects.</p>
<p><strong>WinFS</strong> – Vast improvements in the Windows File System that take us closer to being able to view the file system as a relational database. The addition of extensible metadata schema on top of NTFS will allow users to view data in various ways without having to physically reorganize the data. For example, you could view documents by project first, then author, or author first, then project, without having to change the underlying structure of the file system. Currently, with folders, we can only choose one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Avalon</strong> – The code-name for the next generation of graphics processing engines in Windows which, among many other things, will put much of the graphics processing burden where it belongs, in the GPU (graphics processing unit) rather than using standard CPU cycles. This will allow for vast improvements in application graphics without impacting performance.</p>
<p><strong>Yukon</strong> – The code-name for the next generation of SQL Server. Yukon runs in-process with the Common Language Runtime allowing queries to be executed using any CLR language. Yukon also provides support for XQuery allowing procedures to return query results from XML data which was returned as a result of a T-SQL query. Yukon also provides full support for <em>SQL Cache Invalidation</em> (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Whidbey</strong> – The code-name for the next generation of the Visual Studio.NET IDE. Whidbey provides developers with the language tools that help create applications that take advantage of the new features of <em>WinFX</em> and aid in the development of applications that utilize the <em>Services Model</em> (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Orpheus</strong> – The code-name for the next generation of Visual Studio.NET after Whidbey.</p>
<p><strong>Services Model</strong> – The design philosophy in which application tiers are divided into services by functionality. Often, these tiers are divided into Presentation Services, Business Services (Business Logic) and Data Services. <em>Indigo</em> is designed to support the creation and interaction of these services.</p>
<p><strong>SQL Cache Invalidation</strong> – The interaction between SQL Server and ASP.NET that allows the database to invalidate HTML stored in the IIS cache when the data that the page is based on becomes stale. This ability exists, using new utilities from Microsoft at a table level from SQL Server versions 7 and 2000 and is available to the row level in SQL Server <em>Yukon</em>.</p>

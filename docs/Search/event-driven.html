    <p>There are conflicting opinions among architects about how many microservices a distributed system should have, and the size of those services. Some may say that a particular design has too many microservices, and that it should be consolidated into fewer, larger services to reduce deployment and operational complexity. Others may say that the same design doesn't have enough microservices, and that it should be broken-down into smaller, more granular services to reduce code complexity and improve team agility. Aside from the always true and rarely helpful &quot;it depends...&quot;, is there good guidance on the subject?</p>
<p>The truth is, the number and size of microservices is not a measure of quality or performance unto itself, it is a design decision based on one primary characteristic, <strong>Reliability</strong>. As such, there is a simple rule guiding the creation of services, but it isn't based on the size or quantity of services. The rule is based entirely on how much work a service does.</p>
<p>After security, reliability is the most important attribute of any system, because it affects the satisfaction of both the users and developers, as well as the productivity and agility of the development and support teams. A reliable system has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>It performs its duties as expected</li>
<li>It has minimal failures where it has to report to the user that it is unable to perform its duties</li>
<li>It has minimal downtime when it cannot be reached and opportunities may be lost</li>
<li>It recovers itself automatically when outages do occur, without data loss</li>
</ul>
<p>Having reliable systems means that your support engineers won't be constantly woken-up in the middle of the night to deal with outages, and your customers will remain satisfied with the quality of the product.</p>
<h4>How do we build reliable systems with microservices?</h4>
<p>The key to building reliable systems using microservices is to follow one simple rule: <strong>avoid dual-writes</strong>. A dual-write is when a service makes more than one change to system state within an execution context. Dual-writes are the enemy of reliability, because they create the risk of inconsistency, data loss, and data corruption.</p>
<p>For example, a web API that updates a database and sends a message to a queue during the execution of a single web request is performing a dual-write since it is making two different changes to the state of the system, and both of the changes are expected to occur reliably. If one of the writes succeeds and the other fails, the system state becomes out of sync and system behavior becomes unpredictable. The errors created when these types of failures occur are often hard to find and remediate because they can present very differently depending on the part of the process being executed when the failure happened.</p>
<p>The best-practice is to allow microservices to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence" title="Idempotence is the ability to execute a task an arbitrary number of times (&gt;1) and have the resulting state of the system be the same as if the task was executed once.">idempotent</a> operations like database reads as often as they need, but to only write data once. An <strong>atomic update</strong> to a database is an example of such a write, regardless of how many tables or collections are updated during that process. In this way, we can keep the state of each service consistent, and the system behavior deterministic. If the process fails even part-way through, we know how to recover, and can often do it automatically.</p>
<p>Building this type of system does require a change in how we design our services. In the past, it was very common for us to make multiple changes to a system's state, especially inside a monolithic application. To remain reliable, we need to leverage tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture" title="Events created by a database system when data updates occur that can reliably trigger downstream actions">Change Data Capture (CDC)</a>, which is available in most modern database systems, or the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/transactional-outbox-cosmos" title="Reliably update a data store AND take additional downstream action by atomically writing 2 updates to the data store, the state update, and an event that is monitored for by another system and used to take the additional action">Transactional Outbox Pattern</a> so that we can write our data once, and have that update trigger other activities downstream.</p>
<p>Since microservices are sized to avoid dual-writes, the number of microservices in a system is determined by what they do and how they interact. The number of microservices is not a fixed or arbitrary number, but a result of the system design and the business needs. By following the rule of avoiding dual-writes, you can size your microservices appropriately, and achieve a system that is scalable and adaptable, but most of all, reliable. Of course, this practice alone will not guarantee the reliability of your systems, but it will make reliability possible, and is the best guideline I've found for sizing microservices.</p>
<p>For more detail on how to avoid the Dual-Writes Anti-Pattern, please see my article from December 2022 on <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context.html">The Execution Context</a>.</p>

    <h3>Microservices - Not Just About Scalability</h3>

    <p><strong>Scalability</strong> is an important feature of microservices and event-driven architectures, however it is only one of the many benefits these types of architectures provide. Event-driven designs create systems with high availability and fault tolerance, as well as improvements for the development teams such as flexibility in technology choices and the ability to subdivide tasks better. These features can help make systems more robust and reliable, and have a great impact on development team satisfaction. It is important to consider these types of architectures not just for systems that need to scale to a high degree, but for any system where reliability or complexity are a concern.</p>
<p>The reliability of microservices come from the fact that they break-down monolithic applications into smaller, independently deployable services. When implemented properly this approach allows for the isolation of failures, where the impact of a failure in one service can be limited to that service and its consumers, rather than cascading throughout the entire system. Additionally, microservice architectures enable much easier rollbacks, where if a new service version has a bug, it can be rolled back to a previous version without affecting other services. Event-driven approaches also decouple services by communicating through events rather than direct calls, making it easier to change or replace them without affecting other services. Perhaps most importantly, microservice architectures help reliability by avoiding dual-writes. Ensuring that our services make at most one state change per execution context allows us to avoid the very painful inconsistencies that can occur when data is written to multiple locations simultaneously and these updates are only partially successful.</p>
<p>When asynchronous eventing is used rather than request-response messages, these systems are further decoupled in time, improving fault-tolerance and allowing the systems to self-heal from failures in downstream dependencies. Microservices also enable fault-tolerance in our services by making it possible for some of our services to be idempotent or even fully stateless. Idempotent services can be called repeatedly without additional side-effects, making it easy to recover from failures that occur during our processes.</p>
<p>Finally, microservices improve the development and support process by enabling modularity and allowing each team to use the tools and technologies they prefer. Teams can work on smaller, independent parts of the system, reducing coordination overhead and enabling faster time-to-market for new features and improvements. Each service can be deployed and managed separately, making it easier to manage resource usage and address problems as they arise. These architectures provide greater flexibility and agility, allowing teams to focus on delivering value to the business without being bogged down by the constraints of a monolithic architecture.</p>
<p>While it is true that most systems won't ever need to scale to the point that they <em>require</em> a microservices architecture, many of these same systems do need the reliability and self-healing capabilities modern architectures provide. Additionally, everyone wants to work on a development team that is efficient, accomplishes their goals, and doesn't constantly force them to wake up in the middle of the night to handle support issues.</p>
<p>If you have avoided using event-driven microservices because scalability isn't one of the key features of your application, I encourage you to explore the many other benefits of these architectures.</p>

    <p>Over the last 6 weeks we have discussed the creation, maintenance and operations of microservices and event-driven systems. We explored different conversations that development teams should have prior to working with these types of architectures. Asking the questions we outlined, and answering as many of them as are appropriate, will help teams determine which architectural patterns are best for them, and assist in building their systems and processes in a reliable and supportable way. These conversations are known as &quot;<strong>The Critical C's of Microservices</strong>&quot;, and each is detailed individually in its own article.</p>
<p>The &quot;Critical C's&quot; are: <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context.html">Context</a>, <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-2of6-consistency.html">Consistency</a>, <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-3of6-contract.html">Contract</a>, <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-4of6-chaos.html">Chaos</a>, <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-5of6-competencies.html">Competencies</a> and <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-6of6-coalescence.html">Coalescence</a>. For easy reference, I have aggregated all of the key elements of each conversation in this article. For details about <strong>why</strong> each is important, please consult the article specific to that topic.</p>
<p>There is also a  <a href="..//CriticalCs/index.html">Critical C's of Microservices</a> website that includes the same information as in these articles. This site will be kept up-to-date as the guidance evolves.</p>
<h4>Questions about Context</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context.html">Context</a> that are primarily focused around the tools and techniques that they intend to use to avoid the Dual-Writes Anti-Pattern. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What database technologies will we use and how can we leverage these tools to create downstream events based on changes to the database state?</li>
<li>Which of our services are currently idempotent and which ones could reasonably made so? How can we leverage our idempotent services to improve system reliability?</li>
<li>Do we have any services right now that contain business processes implemented in a less-reliable way? If so, pulling this functionality out into their own microservices might be a good starting point for decomposition.</li>
<li>What processes will we as a development team implement to track and manage the technical debt of having business processes implemented in a less-reliable way?</li>
<li>What processes will we implement to be sure that any future less-reliable implementations of business functionality are made with consideration and understanding of the debt being created and a plan to pay it off.</li>
<li>What processes will we implement to be sure that any existing or future less-reliable implementations of business functionality are documented, understood by, and prioritized by the business process owners.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Questions about Consistency</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-2of6-consistency.html">Consistency</a> that are primarily focused around making certain that the system is assumed to be eventually consistency throughout. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What patterns and tools will we use to create systems that support reliable, eventually consistent operations?</li>
<li>How will we identify existing areas where higher-levels of consistency have been wedged-in and should be removed?</li>
<li>How will we prevent future demands for higher-levels of consistency, either explicit or assumed, to creep in to our systems?</li>
<li>How will we identify when there are unusual or unacceptable delays in the system reaching a consistent state?</li>
<li>How will we communicate the status of the system and any delays in reaching a consistent state to the relevant stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Questions about Contract</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-3of6-contract.html">Contract</a> that are primarily focused around creating processes that define any integration contracts for both upstream and downstream services, and serve to defend their internal data representations against any external consumers. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will we isolate our internal data representations from those of our downstream consumers?</li>
<li>What types of compatibility guarantees are our tools and practices capable of providing?</li>
<li>What procedures should we have in place to monitor incoming and outgoing contracts for compatibility?</li>
<li>What should our procedures look like for making a change to a stream that has downstream consumers?</li>
<li>How can we leverage upstream messaging contracts to further reduce the coupling of our systems to our upstream dependencies?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Questions about Chaos</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-4of6-chaos.html">Chaos</a> that are primarily focused around procedures for identifying and remediating possible failure points in the application. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will we evaluate potential sources of failures in our systems before they are built?
<ul>
<li>How will we handle the inability to reach a dependency such as a database?</li>
<li>How will we handle duplicate messages sent from our upstream data sources?</li>
<li>How will we handle messages sent out-of-order from our upstream data sources?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How will we expose possible sources of failures during any pre-deployment testing?</li>
<li>How will we expose possible sources of failures in the production environment before they occur for users?</li>
<li>How will we identify errors that occur for users within production?</li>
<li>How will we prioritize changes to the system based on the results of these experiments?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Questions about Competencies</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-5of6-competencies.html">Competencies</a> that are primarily focused around what systems, sub-systems, and components should be built, which should be installed off-the-shelf, and what libraries or infrastructure capabilities should be utilized. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are our core competencies?</li>
<li>How do we identify &quot;build vs. buy&quot; opportunities?</li>
<li>How do we make &quot;build vs. buy&quot; decisions on needed systems?</li>
<li>How do we identify cross-cutting concerns and infrastructure capabilites that can be leveraged?</li>
<li>How do we determine which libraries or infrastructure components will be utilized?</li>
<li>How do we manage the versioning of utilized components, especially in regard to security updates?</li>
<li>How do we document our decisions for later review?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Questions about Coalescence</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-6of6-coalescence.html">Coalescence</a> that are primarily focused around brining critical information about the operation of our systems together for easy access. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is our mechanism for deployment and system verification?
<ul>
<li>How will we identify, as quickly as possible, when a deployment has had a negative impact on our system?</li>
<li>Are there tests that can validate the operation of the system end-to-end?</li>
<li>How will we surface the status of any deployment and system verification tests?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is our mechanism for logging/traceability within our system?
<ul>
<li>How will we coalesce our logs from the various services within the system?</li>
<li>How will we know if there are anomalies in our logs?</li>
<li>Are there additional identifiers we need to add to allow traceability?</li>
<li>Are there log queries that, if enabled, might provide additional support during an outage?</li>
<li>Are there ways to increase the level of logging when needed to provide additional information and can this be done wholistically on the system?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How will we expose SLIs and other metrics so they are available when needed?</li>
<li>How will we know when there are anomalies in our metrics?</li>
<li>What are the metrics that would be needed in an outage and how will we surface those for easy access?</li>
<li>Are there additional metrics that, if enabled, might provide additional support during an outage?</li>
<li>Are there ways to perform ad-hoc queries against SLIs and metrics to provide additional insight in an outage?</li>
<li>How will we identify the status of dependencies so we can understand when our systems are reacting to downstream anomalies?
<ul>
<li>How will we surface dependency status for easy access during an outage?</li>
<li>Are there metrics we can surface for our dependencies that might help during an outage?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <p>&quot;<strong>The Critical C's of Microservices</strong>&quot; are a series of conversations that development teams should have around building event-driven or other microservice based architectures. These topics will help teams determine which architectural patterns are best for them, and assist in building their systems and processes in a reliable and supportable way.</p>
<p>The &quot;Critical C's&quot; are: <strong>Context</strong>, <strong>Consistency</strong>, <strong>Contract</strong>, <strong>Chaos</strong>, <strong>Competencies</strong> and <strong>Coalescence</strong>. Each of these topics has been covered in detail in this series of 6 articles. The first article of the 6 was on the subject of <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context.html">Context</a>. This is the final article in the series, and covers the topic of <strong>Coalescence</strong>.</p>
<h4>Coalescence</h4>
<p>The use of Microservices reduces the complexity of our services in many ways, however it also adds complexity when it comes to deployment and operations. More services mean more deployments, even as each of those deployments is smaller and more isolated. Additionally, they can be harder on operations and support teams since there can be many more places to go when you need to find information. Ideally, we would coalesce all of the necessary information to operate and troubleshoot our systems in a single pane-of-glass so that our operations and support engineers don't have to search for information in a crisis.</p>
<p>Deployment and system verification testing can help us identify when there are problems at any point in our system and give us insight into what the problems might be and what caused them. Tests run immediately after any deployment can help identify when a particular deployment has caused a problem so it can be addressed quickly. Likewise, ongoing system verification tests can give early indications of problems irrespective of the cause. Getting information about the results of these tests quickly and easily into the hands of the engineers that can act on them can reduce costs and prevent outages.</p>
<p>Logging and traceability is generally considered a solved problem, so long as it is used effectively. We need to setup our systems to make the best use of our distributed logging systems. This often means adding a correlation identifier alongside various request and causation ids to make it easy to trace requests through the system. We also need to be able to monitor and surface our logs so that unusual activity can be recognized and acted on as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and other metrics can provide key insights into the operations of our systems, even if no unusual activity is seen within our logs. Knowing what operational metrics suggest there might be problems within our systems, and monitoring changes to those metrics for both our services and our dependencies can help identify, troubleshoot and even prevent outages. Surfacing those metrics for easy access can give our support and operations engineers the tools they need to do their jobs effectively.</p>
<h4>Goals of the Conversation</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <strong>Coalescence</strong> that are primarily focused around brining critical information about the operation of our systems together for easy access. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is our mechanism for deployment and system verification?
<ul>
<li>How will we identify, as quickly as possible, when a deployment has had a negative impact on our system?</li>
<li>Are there tests that can validate the operation of the system end-to-end?</li>
<li>How will we surface the status of any deployment and system verification tests?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is our mechanism for logging/traceability within our system?
<ul>
<li>How will we coalesce our logs from the various services within the system?</li>
<li>How will we know if there are anomalies in our logs?</li>
<li>Are there additional identifiers we need to add to allow traceability?</li>
<li>Are there log queries that, if enabled, might provide additional support during an outage?</li>
<li>Are there ways to increase the level of logging when needed to provide additional information and can this be done wholistically on the system?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How will we expose SLIs and other metrics so they are available when needed?</li>
<li>How will we know when there are anomalies in our metrics?</li>
<li>What are the metrics that would be needed in an outage and how will we surface those for easy access?</li>
<li>Are there additional metrics that, if enabled, might provide additional support during an outage?</li>
<li>Are there ways to perform ad-hoc queries against SLIs and metrics to provide additional insight in an outage?</li>
<li>How will we identify the status of dependencies so we can understand when our systems are reacting to downstream anomalies?
<ul>
<li>How will we surface dependency status for easy access during an outage?</li>
<li>Are there metrics we can surface for our dependencies that might help during an outage?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <p>&quot;<strong>The Critical C's of Microservices</strong>&quot; are a series of conversations that development teams should have around building event-driven or other microservice based architectures. These topics will help teams determine which architectural patterns are best for them, and assist in building their systems and processes in a reliable and supportable way.</p>
<p>The &quot;Critical C's&quot; are: <strong>Context</strong>, <strong>Consistency</strong>, <strong>Contract</strong>, <strong>Chaos</strong>, <strong>Competencies</strong> and <strong>Coalescence</strong>. Each of these topics will be covered in detail in this series of articles. The first article of the 6 was on the subject of <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context.html">Context</a>. This is article 5 of the series, and covers the topic of <strong>Competencies</strong>.</p>
<h4>Competencies</h4>
<p>It is our responsibility as engineers to spend our limited resources on those things that give the companies we are building for a competitive advantage in the market. This means limiting our software builds to areas where we can differentiate that company from others. Not every situation requires us to build a custom solution, and even when we do, there is usually no need for us to build every component of that system.</p>
<p>If the problem we are solving is a common one that many companies deal with, and our solution does not give us a competitive advantage over those other companies, we are probably better off using an off-the-shelf product, whether that is a commercial (COTS) product, or a Free or Open-Source one (FOSS). Software we build should be unique to the company it is being built for, and provide that company with a competitive advantage. There is no need for us to build another Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) or Accounting system since these systems implement solutions to solved problemns that are generally solved in the same way by everyone. We should only build custom solutions if we are doing something that has never been done before or we need to do things in a way that is different from everyone else and can't be done using off-the-shelf systems.</p>
<p>We should also only be building custom software when the problem being solved is part of our company's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_competency" title="A combination of multiple resources and skills that distinguish a firm in the marketplace and therefore are the foundation of companies' competitiveness">core competencies</a>. If we are doing this work for a company that builds widgets, it is unlikely, though not impossible, that building a custom solution for getting parts needed to build the widgets will provide that company with a competitive advantage. We are probably better off if we focus our efforts on software to help make the widgets in ways that are better, faster or cheaper.</p>
<p>If our &quot;build vs. buy&quot; decision is to build a custom solution, there are likely to be opportunities within those systems to use pre-existing capabilities rather than writing everything from scratch. For example, many cross-cutting concerns within our applications have libraries that support them very effectively. We should not be coding our own implementations for things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing)" title="The act of keeping a log of events that occur in a computer system, such as problems, errors or just information on current operation">logging</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_configuration" title="The arrangement of a system's functional units according to their nature, number and chief characteristics">configuration</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security" title="Protection from or resilience against, potential harm (or other unwanted coercive change) caused by others, by restraining the freedom of others to act">security</a>. Likewise, there are many capabilities that already exist in our infrastructure that we should take advantage of. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption" title="The process of encoding information">Encryption</a>, which is often a capability of the operating system, is one that springs to mind. We should certainly never &quot;roll-our-own&quot; for more complex infrastructure features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)" title="Sharing information so as to ensure consistency between redundant resources, such as software or hardware components, to improve reliability, fault-tolerance, or accessibility.">Replication</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture" title="CDC is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track the data that has changed so that action can be taken using the changed data.">Change Data Capture</a>, but might even want to consider avoiding rebuilding infrastructure capabilities that we more commonly build. An example of this might be if we would typically build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API" title="An Application Programming Interface exposed over HTTP(S)">Web API</a> for our systems, we might consider exposing the API's of our backing infrastructure components instead, properly isolated and secured of course, perhaps via an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_management" title="The process of creating and publishing web application programming interfaces (APIs), enforcing their usage policies, controlling access, nurturing the subscriber community, collecting and analyzing usage statistics, and reporting on performance">API Management</a> component.</p>
<h4>Goals of the Conversation</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <strong>Competencies</strong> that are primarily focused around what systems, sub-systems, and components should be built, which should be installed off-the-shelf, and what libraries or infrastructure capabilities should be utilized. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are our core competencies?</li>
<li>How do we identify &quot;build vs. buy&quot; opportunities?</li>
<li>How do we make &quot;build vs. buy&quot; decisions on needed systems?</li>
<li>How do we identify cross-cutting concerns and infrastructure capabilites that can be leveraged?</li>
<li>How do we determine which libraries or infrastructure components will be utilized?</li>
<li>How do we manage the versioning of utilized components, especially in regard to security updates?</li>
<li>How do we document our decisions for later review?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Next Up - Coalescence</h4>
<p>In the final article of this series we will look at <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-6of6-coalescence.html">Coalescence</a> and how we should work to bring all of the data together for our operations &amp; support engineers.</p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>The Critical C's of Microservices</strong>&quot; are a series of conversations that development teams should have around building event-driven or other microservice based architectures. These topics will help teams determine which architectural patterns are best for them, and assist in building their systems and processes in a reliable and supportable way.</p>
<p>The &quot;Critical C's&quot; are: <strong>Context</strong>, <strong>Consistency</strong>, <strong>Contract</strong>, <strong>Chaos</strong>, <strong>Competencies</strong> and <strong>Coalescence</strong>. Each of these topics will be covered in detail in this series of articles. The first article of the 6 was on the subject of <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context.html">Context</a>. This is article 4 of the series, and covers the topic of <strong>Chaos</strong>.</p>
<h4>Chaos</h4>
<p>One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">Fallacies of Distributed Computing</a> is that the network is reliable. We should have similarly low expectations for the reliability of all of the infrastructure on which our services depend. Networks will segment, commodity servers and drives will fail, containers and operating systems will become unstable. In other words, our software will have errors during operation, no matter how resilient we attempt to make it. We need to embrace the fact that failures will occur in our software, and will do so at random times and often in unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>If we are to build systems that don't require our constant attention, especially during off-hours, we need to be able to identify what happens when failures occur, and design our systems in ways that will allow them to heal automatically once the problem is corrected.</p>
<p>To start this process, I recommend playing &quot;what-if&quot; games using diagrams of the system. Walk through the components of the system, and how the data flows through it, identifying each place where a failure could occur. Then, in each area where failures could happen, attempt to define the possible failure modes and explore what the impact of those failures might be. This kind of &quot;virtual&quot; Chaos Engineering is certainly no substitute for actual experimentation and testing, but is a good starting point for more in-depth analysis. It also can be very valuable in helping to understand the system and to produce more hardened services in the future.</p>
<p>Thought experiments are useful, but you cannot really know how a system will respond to different types of failures until you have those failures in production. Historically, such &quot;tests&quot; have occurred at random, at the whim of the infrastructure, and usually at the worst possible time. Instead of leaving these things to chance, tools like <em>Chaos Monkey</em> can be used to simulate failures in production, and can be configured to create these failures during times where the appropriate support engineers are available and ready to respond if necessary. This way, we can see if our systems respond as we expect, and more importantly, heal themselves as we expect.</p>
<p>Even if you're not ready to jump into using automated experimentation tools in production just yet, a lot can be learned from using feature-flags and changing service behaviors in a more controlled manner as a starting point. This might involve a flag that can be set to cause an API method to return an error response, either as a hard failure, or during random requests for a period of time. Perhaps a switch could be set to stop a service from picking-up asynchronous messages from a queue or topic. Of course, these flags can only be placed in code we control, so we can't test failures of dependencies like databases and other infrastructure components in this way. For that, we'll need more involved testing methods.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we test our systems, it is important that we do everything we can to build systems that will heal themselves without the need for us to intervene every time a failure occurs. As a result, I highly recommend using asynchronous messaging patterns whenever possible. The asynchrony of these tools allow our services to be &quot;temporally decoupled&quot; from their dependencies. As a result, if a container fails and is restarted by Kubernetes, any message in process is rolled-back onto the queue or topic, and the system can pick right up where it left off.</p>
<h4>Goals of the Conversation</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <strong>Chaos</strong> that are primarily focused around procedures for identifying and remediating possible failure points in the application. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will we evaluate potential sources of failures in our systems before they are built?
<ul>
<li>How will we handle the inability to reach a dependency such as a database?</li>
<li>How will we handle duplicate messages sent from our upstream data sources?</li>
<li>How will we handle messages sent out-of-order from our upstream data sources?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How will we expose possible sources of failures during any pre-deployment testing?</li>
<li>How will we expose possible sources of failures in the production environment before they occur for users?</li>
<li>How will we identify errors that occur for users within production?</li>
<li>How will we prioritize changes to the system based on the results of these experiments?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Next Up - Competencies</h4>
<p>In the next article of this series we will look at <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-5of6-competencies.html">Competencies</a> and how we should focus at least as much on what we build as how we build it.</p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>The Critical C's of Microservices</strong>&quot; are a series of conversations that development teams should have around building event-driven or other microservice based architectures. These topics will help teams determine which architectural patterns are best for them, and assist in building their systems and processes in a reliable and supportable way.</p>
<p>The &quot;Critical C's&quot; are: <strong>Context</strong>, <strong>Consistency</strong>, <strong>Contract</strong>, <strong>Chaos</strong>, <strong>Competencies</strong> and <strong>Coalescence</strong>. Each of these topics will be covered in detail in this series of articles. The first article of the 6 was on the subject of <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context.html">Context</a>. This is article 3 of the series, and covers the topic of <strong>Contract</strong>.</p>
<h4>Contract</h4>
<p>Once a message has been defined and agreed to as an integration mechanism, all stakeholders in that integration have legitimate expectations of that message contract. Primarily, these expectations includes the agreed-to level of compatibility of future messages, and what the process will be when the contract needs to change. These guarantees will often be such that messages can add fields as needed, but cannot remove, move, or change the nature of existing fields without significant coordination with the stakeholders. This can have a severe impact on the <strong>agility</strong> of our dev teams as they try to move fast and iterate with their designs.</p>
<p>In order to keep implementations flexible, there should be an isolation layer between the internal representation (Domain Model) of any message, and the more public representation (Integration Model). This way, the developers can change the internal representation with only limited restrictions, so long as as the message remains transformationally compatible with the integration message, and the transformation is modified as needed so that no change is seen by the integration consumers. The two representations may take different forms, such as one in a database, the other in a Kafka topic. The important thing is that the developers can iterate quickly on the internal representation when they need to.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/CTP%20Pattern%20-%20Eventually%20Consistent.png" alt="Drawing showing 2 different representations of a WorkOrder in the same Workflow - 1 stored in the DB the other in Kafka" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Eventually Consistent</strong> example from the earlier <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-2of6-consistency.html">Consistency</a> topic (included above) shows such an isolation layer since the <em>WorkOrders DB</em> holds the internal representation of the message, the <em>Kafka Connect</em> connector is the abstraction that performs the transformation as needed, and the topic that the connector produces data to is the integration path. In this model, the development team can iterate on the model inside the DB without necessarily needing to make changes to the more public Kafka topic.</p>
<p>We need to take great care to defend these internal streams and keep them isolated. Ideally, only 1 service should ever write to our domain model, and only internal services, owned by the same small development team, should read from it. As soon as we allow other teams into our domain model, it becomes an integration model whether we want it to be or not. Even other internal services should use the public representation if it is reasonable to do so.</p>
<p>Similarly, our services should make proper use of upstream integration models. We need to understand what level of compatibility we can expect and how we will be notified of changes. We should use these data paths as much as possible to bring external data locally to our services, in exactly the form that our service needs it in, so that each of our services can own its own data for both reliability and efficiency. Of course, these local stores must be read-only. We need to publish change requests back to the <em>System of Record</em> to make any changes to data sourced by those systems.</p>
<p>We should also do everything we can to avoid making assumptions about data we don't own. Assuming a data type, particular provenance, or embedded-intelligence of a particular upstream data field will often cause problems in the future because we have created unnecessary coupling. As an example, it is good practice to treat all foreign identifiers as strings, even if they look like integers, and to never make assumptions along the lines of &quot;...those identifiers will always be increasing in value&quot;. While these may be safe assumptions for a while, they should be avoided if they reasonably can be to prevent future problems.</p>
<h4>Goals of the Conversation</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <strong>Contract</strong> that are primarily focused around creating processes that define any integration contracts for both upstream and downstream services, and serve to defend their internal data representations against any external consumers. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will we isolate our internal data representations from those of our downstream consumers?</li>
<li>What types of compatibility guarantees are our tools and practices capable of providing?</li>
<li>What procedures should we have in place to monitor incoming and outgoing contracts for compatibility?</li>
<li>What should our procedures look like for making a change to a stream that has downstream consumers?</li>
<li>How can we leverage upstream messaging contracts to further reduce the coupling of our systems to our upstream dependencies?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Next Up - Chaos</h4>
<p>In the next article of this series we will look at <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-4of6-chaos.html">Chaos</a> and how we can use both thought and physical experiments to help improve our system's reliability.</p>

Each of these topics will be covered in detail in this series of articles. Article 1 of the 6 was on the subject of <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-1of6-context.html">Context</a>. This is article 2 of the series, and covers the topic of <strong>Consistency</strong>.</p>
<h4>Consistency</h4>
<p>The world is eventually consistent. The sooner we get that through our heads and start expecting our systems to act like it, the fewer problems, we will have. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say that most of the problems in building and maintaining microservice architectures are the result of failing to fully embrace eventual consistency from the start.</p>
<p>Data is consistent when it appears the same way when viewed from multiple perspectives. Our systems are said to be consistent when all of the data them is consistent. A system with strong consistency guarantees would be one where every actor, anywhere in the context of the application, would see the exact same value for any data element at any given time. A system that is <em>eventually consistent</em> is one with strong guarantees that the data will reach all intended targets, but much weaker guarantees about how long it might take to achieve data consistency.</p>
<p>Full consistency is impossible in a world where there is a finite speed of causation. Strong consistency can only be achieved when every portion of the application waits until the data is fully consistent before processing. This is generally quite difficult unless all of the data is housed in a single, ACID compliant data store, which of course, is a very bad idea when building scalable systems. <strong>Strong</strong> consistency, or anything more stringent than <strong>eventual</strong> consistency, may be appropriate under very specific circumstances when data stores are being geo-replicated (assuming the database server is designed for such a thing), but can cause real difficulties, especially in the areas of reliability and scalability, when attempted inside an application.</p>
<p>We should challenge demands for higher levels of consistency with rigor. Attempts to provide stronger consistency guarantees than <em>eventual</em> will cause far more problems than they are worth.</p>
<p>We will always need to look for situations where consistency problems might occur (i.e. race-conditions), expect them to happen, and try to design our systems in such a way as to not need to worry about them. Race conditions and other consistency problems are smells. If you are in a situation where you are might see these types of problems, it may indicate that you need to reevaluate the details of your implementation.</p>
<p>As an example, let's take a look at the 3 implementation diagrams below. In all 3 of these implementations, the goal is to have the WorkOrder service modify a WorkOrder and have the changes published onto a topic for downstream consumers. If a WorkOrder already exists, it needs to be loaded from the data store so that appropriate updates can be made. As you will see, the 3 implementations have very different reliability characteristics.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/CTP%20Pattern%20-%20Race%20Condition.png" alt="3 Possible Implementations - Entity Updated and Published" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implementation 1 - Dual-Write</strong>: In the 1st example, the WorkOrder service attempts to both update the entity in the database, and publish the changes to the topic for downstream consumers. This is probably an attempt to keep both the event and the update consistent with one another, and is often mistaken for the simplest solution. However, since it is impossible to make more than 1 reliable change at a time, the only way this implementation can guarantee reliability is if the 1st update is done in an idempotent way. If that is the case, in the circumstances where the 2nd update fails, the service can roll the command message back onto the original topic and try the entire change again. Notice however that this doesn't guarantee consistency at all. If the DB is updated first, it may be done well before the publication ever occurs, since a retry would end up causing the publication to occur on a later attempt. Attempting to be clever and use a DB transaction to maintain consistency actually makes the problem worse for reasons that are outside of the scope of this discussion. Only a distributed transaction across the database and topic would accomplish that, and would do so at the expense of system scalability.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation 2 - Race Condition</strong>: In the 2nd example, the WorkOrder service reads data from the DB, and uses that to publish any needed updates to the topic. The topic is then used to feed the database, as well as any additional downstream consumers. While it might seem like the race-condition would be obvious here, it is not uncommon to miss this kind of systemic problem in a more complicated environment. It also can be tempting to build the system this way if the original implementation did not involve the DB. If we are adding the data store, we need to make sure data access happens prior to creating downstream events to avoid this kind of race condition. Stay vigilant for these types of scenarios and be willing to make the changes needed to protect the reliability of your system when requirements change.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation 3 - Eventually Consistent</strong>: In the 3rd example, the DB is used directly by both the WorkOrder service, and as the source of changes to the topic. This scenario is reliable but only <strong>eventually consistent</strong>. That is, we know that both the DB and the topic will be updated since the WorkOrder service makes the DB update directly, and the reliable change feed from the DB instantiates a new execution context for the topic to be updated. This way, there is only a single change to system state made within each execution context, and we can know that they will happen reliably.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example of a consistency smell might be when end-users insist that their UI should not return after they update something in an app, until the data is guaranteed to be consistent. I don't blame users for making these requests. After all, we trained them that the way to be sure that a system is reliable is to hit refresh until they see the data. In this situation, assuming we can't talk the users out of it, our best path is to make the UI wait until our polling, or a notification mechanism, identifies that the data is now consistent. I think this is a pretty rude thing to do to our users, but if they insist on it, I can only advise them against it. I will not destroy the scalability of systems I design, and add complexity to these systems that the developers will need to maintain forever, by simulating consistency deeper inside the app. The internals of the application should be considered eventually consistent at all times and we need to get used to thinking about our systems in this way.</p>
<h4>Goals of the Conversation</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <strong>Consistency</strong> that are primarily focused around making certain that the system is assumed to be eventually consistency throughout. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What patterns and tools will we use to create systems that support reliable, eventually consistent operations?</li>
<li>How will we identify existing areas where higher-levels of consistency have been wedged-in and should be removed?</li>
<li>How will we prevent future demands for higher-levels of consistency, either explicit or assumed, to creep in to our systems?</li>
<li>How will we identify when there are unusual or unacceptable delays in the system reaching a consistent state?</li>
<li>How will we communicate the status of the system and any delays in reaching a consistent state to the relevant stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Next Up - Contract</h4>
<p>In the next article of this series we will look at <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-3of6-contract.html">Contract</a> and how we can leverage contracts to make our systems more reliable while still maintaining our agility.</p>

    <p>&quot;<strong>The Critical C's of Microservices</strong>&quot; are a series of conversations that development teams should have around building event-driven or other microservice based architectures. These topics will help teams determine which architectural patterns are best for them, and assist in building their systems and processes in a reliable and supportable way.</p>
<p>The &quot;Critical C's&quot; are: <strong>Context</strong>, <strong>Consistency</strong>, <strong>Contract</strong>, <strong>Chaos</strong>, <strong>Competencies</strong> and <strong>Coalescence</strong>. Each of these topics will be covered in detail in this series of articles, starting with <strong>Context</strong>.</p>
<p>Update: Part 2 of this series, <a href="../Posts/critical-cs-of-microservices-2of6-consistency.html">Consistency</a> is now available.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<h4>The Execution Context</h4>
<p>The <strong>execution context</strong> is the unit of work of all services. It represents the life-cycle of a single request, regardless of the details of how that request was received. So, whether an HTTP web request, or an asynchronous message from <em>Apache Kafka</em> or <em>Azure Service Bus</em>, the context we care about here is that of a single service processing that one message. Since, for reasons that will be discussed in a future article, there is no way to reliably make more than one change to system state within a single execution context, we must defend this context from the tendency to add additional state changes which would damage the reliability of our services.</p>
<p>There are generally only two situations where it is ok to make more than one change to system state in a single execution context:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When the first change is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence" title="Idempotence is the ability to execute a task an arbitrary number of times (&gt;1) and have the resulting state of the system be the same as if the task was executed once.">idempotent</a> so we can rollback the message and try again later without bad things happening due to duplication. An example of this is a database <strong>Upsert</strong> where all of the data, including keys, is supplied. In this case, the 1st time we execute the request, we might insert the record in the DB. If a later change fails in the same context and we end up receiving the same message a 2nd time, the resulting update using the same data will leave the system in the same state as if the request was only executed once. Since this <em>idempotent</em> operation can be executed as many times as necessary without impacting the ultimate state of the system, we can make other changes after this one and still rollback and retry the request if a subsequent operation fails, without damaging the system. Services that are <em>idempotent</em> are much easier to orchestrate reliably, so much so that <em>idempotence</em> is considered a highly-desireable feature of microservices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the second change is understood to be less-reliable. An example of this is logging. We don't want to fail a business-process due to failures in logging, so we accept that our logging, and certain other technical processes, may be less-reliable than our business processes. It is <strong>rarely</strong> ok for a business process to be less-reliable in this way. Implementations that make certain business features less-reliable should be identified, documented, and discussed with an eye toward repaying what is likely to be technical debt.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Avoiding Dual-Writes</h4>
<p>Ultimately, to maintain the reliability of our systems, we must be sure we are never trying to make more than one reliable change to system state in a single execution context. This is a very different way of thinking than most developers are used to. In fact, I would say it is the opposite of how many of us have been taught to think about these types of problems. Developers value simplicity, and rightfully so. Unfortunately, problems where we already have a service running that can host logic we need to add, make it <strong>seem like</strong> the simplest solution is to just &quot;add-on&quot; the new logic to the existing code. The truth of the matter is far different. Let's look at an example:</p>
<p><img src="../Images/CTP%20Pattern%20-%20Never%20Add-On.png" alt="Defend the Execution Context" /></p>
<p>In these drawings we start with a RESTful service that updates a database and returns an appropriate response. This service makes only 1 change to system state so it can be built reliably.</p>
<p>The next two drawings show ways of implementing a new requirement for the system to update a downstream dependency, say a Kafka topic, in addition to the database update. The default for many Technologists would be to just to add-on inside the service. That is, they might suggest that we should have the service update both the database and the topic as shown in the second drawing. This would be an example of the Dual-Writes Anti-Pattern and would hurt both system <em>reliability</em> and <em>supportability</em>.</p>
<p>Instead, the simplest solution that doesn't harm our system's reliability is actually to trigger the downstream action off of the DB update. That is, we can use the <strong>Outbox Pattern</strong> or if the database supports it, <strong>Change Data Capture</strong> or a <strong>Change Feed</strong> to trigger a secondary process that produces the event message. Adding a deployment unit like this might make it feel like a more complicated solution, however it actually reduces the complexity of the initial service, avoids making a change to a working service, and will avoid creating reliability problems by not performing dual-writes.</p>
<p>There are a few things to note here regarding atomic database transactions. An ACID-compliant update to a database represents a single change to system state. If we could make fully ACID-compliant changes across multiple data stores, or other boundaries like web services, the Dual-Writes Anti-Pattern would be much less of a problem. Unfortunately, distributed transactions cannot be used without severely impacting both scalability and performance and are not recommended. It should also be noted that, when talking about only 2 state changes, some threats to reliability may be reduced by being clever with our use of transactions. However, these tricks help us far less than one might think, and have severely diminishing returns when 3 or more state-changes are in-scope. Transactions, while good for keeping local data consistent, are not good for maintaining system reliability and are horrible for system scalability.</p>
<h4>Goals of the Conversation</h4>
<p>Development teams should have conversations around <strong>Context</strong> that are primarily focused around the tools and techniques that they intend to use to avoid the Dual-Writes Anti-Pattern. These conversations should include answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What database technologies will we use and how can we leverage these tools to create downstream events based on changes to the database state?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Which of our services are currently idempotent and which ones could reasonably made so? How can we leverage our idempotent services to improve system reliability?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do we have any services right now that contain business processes implemented in a less-reliable way? If so, pulling this functionality out into their own microservices might be a good starting point for decomposition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What processes will we as a development team implement to track and manage the technical debt of having business processes implemented in a less-reliable way?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What processes will we implement to be sure that any future less-reliable implementations of business functionality are made with consideration and understanding of the debt being created and a plan to pay it off.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What processes will we implement to be sure that any existing or future less-reliable implementations of business functionality are documented, understood by, and prioritized by the business process owners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Next Up - Consistency</h4>

    <h2>What is Event Storming?</h2>
<p>Event storming is a process for building a model of a problem domain by analyzing the domain from a business perspective. The results of an Event Storming session include a logical model of the domain, as seen by the business owners, that is extremely useful to engineers in defining software systems for that domain. Event Storming follows a four-step process to produce a model of the system that is based on Domain Events, historical facts about the business process that are relevant to the business owners.</p>
<p>The process occurs on a whiteboard surface, ideally in-person but often virtually. Sticky-notes of various colors are used to represent elements of the domain and the model is built-up by everyone on the team, regardless of their role. The exercise starts as a brainstorming session of a sort, then evolves until it results in a model of the business process.</p>
<h2>The Goals of Event Storming</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Produce a model of the domain that is valuable to both the business owners and the engineers who are building software systems for that domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Document a Ubiquitous Language for the domain that represents the shared set of terms used by everyone working in that domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Level everyone in the domain on the same understanding of what problems are being solved so that all players have a strong working background.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Important Terminology</h2>
<p>Note: The items below represent the different elements of the model we wish to produce. Each type of item is represented by a different color of sticky-note on our design surface. Terms not color-coded exist in the context of Domain Driven Design and may be used during the session, but will not be modeled on the board.</p>
<h3>Aggregate</h3>
<p>An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. An example may be an order and its line-items. These objects will likely be created from distinct classes when built within the context of a software system, but it is useful to treat them as a single aggregate for the purposes of modeling the domain. That is, it is simpler to think about an Order with all of its line-items as a single unit within the model. Additionally, some objects will be able to be viewed from multiple perspectives. If we model a User which contains a collection of Roles, we could also see a Role as having a collection of users. The User and Role objects are each separate aggregates and can be modeled separately depending on the context, even though they represent the same relationship and a collection of one object likely exists on the other. The primary object within each Aggregate is known as the Aggregate Root which is used to describe the aggregate as a whole.</p>
<h3>Bounded Context</h3>
<p>A Bounded Context is a logical area within a system where business processes are implemented, a ubiquitous language is applied, and certain terms make very clear and specific sense. A term can have exactly one meaning within a bounded context, a meaning which may not be exactly the same as that same term in another bounded context. As an example, let's look at a Customer object.  Bounded Contexts that exist in a state after a user has logged-in to the system might have a User object or UserId property associated with it. Meanwhile, this User object or UserId may not exist in a Bounded Context that exists purely pre-login, or where login status has no bearing on the functionality.</p>
<h3>Business Process (dark purple stickies)</h3>
<p>The business rules and logic required to handle a Command or a Domain Event. A business process may create one or more domain events, or may reject the command outright.</p>
<h3>Command (light blue stickies)</h3>
<p>An instruction submitted by a user, usually through a view, that typically results in the creation of one or more Domain Events. Commands may be rejected by the Business Processes that handle them, perhaps due to permissions or data validation issues. If a command is rejected, it may or may not result in one or more domain events representing the submission and/or rejection of that command.</p>
<h3>Domain Event (orange stickies)</h3>
<p>Domain Events are the keys to Event Storming. A Domain Event is something that happened in the domain that is relevant to the business. Events are always written in the past tense since they represent historical facts that cannot change. Examples of domain events include “vehicle locked” and “delivery scheduled.” Though the term event is somewhat overloaded, these Domain Events should not be conflated with the messages that can be used to represent them. While many Domain Events will eventually be represented by event messages of some form, many will not. Event Storming is an implementation agnostic process, thus there is no prescription as to how events are communicated. Domain events, in this context, exist entirely as historical facts and nothing more.</p>
<h3>External System (light purple stickies)</h3>
<p>A third-party service provider such as a payment gateway or shipping company. These services may utilize View Models within our system and may create Domain Events that trigger Business Processes.</p>
<h3>Questions or Risks (pink or red stickies)</h3>
<p>We use pink stickies to identify items that are unclear, overly complex or have unanswered questions or risks. Callout concerns with these pink stickies liberally whenever there is something that should be known about an item or area of the model. Sections of the model where there are a lot of pink sticky notes may require additional attention.</p>
<h3>Ubiquitous Language</h3>
<p>A set of terms describing the domain that are meaningful to the business team. These are the terms that are used by all domain team members to identify and communicate about activities of the system. A sample excerpted from a Ubiquitous Language document is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/UbiquitousLanguageSample.png" alt="Sample from a Ubiquitous Language Document" /></p>
<h3>User/Actor (yellow stickies)</h3>
<p>A person who interacts with the system. These interactions will usually take the form of executing a Command, typically through a view populated by a  View Model.</p>
<h3>View / Read Model (light green stickies)</h3>
<p>A presentation of data that Users, Business Processes, and External Systems interact with to carry out a task in the system. As an example, an external system may call a REST service within the domain that returns data that we represent with a View Model.</p>
<h2>The Event Storming Process</h2>
<p>Each step builds on the previous steps to result in a cohesive picture of the domain from a business perspective. This view of the system has proven to be extremely useful to engineers in defining software systems for that domain.</p>
<h3>1 - Collect Domain Events</h3>
<p>The first step in Event Storming is to brainstorm the Domain Events that occur during the course of the business process. These events should be described on orange sticky notes using verbs in the past-tense. Each sticky should represent a single event and should be placed on the modeling surface in roughly chronological order. Since this is brainstorming, we should limit the amount of time we spend discussing and refining each event. There will be more time for that in step 2. However, we do want to have enough discussion to trigger thoughts on additional events which often result from these conversations.</p>
<p>Any events where there are unresolved questions or concerns should be marked with a pink sticky note indicating the question or risk. In this first step we should make liberal use of these stickies.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/EventStorming-CollectDomainEvents.png" alt="After Step 1 - Collect Domain Events" /></p>
<h3>2 - Refine Domain Events</h3>
<p>Once we have thrown all of the events we can think of on the board, we can start to refine those events. In step 1 we were brainstorming so multiple side-conversations may have been occurring at various times. In step 2 we want to bring the entire team together in a single conversation about each event. This is where we drill-in to the details of the events, and modify our model as appropriate.</p>
<p>We begin by walking through the timeline, usually from left to right, but jumping around as needed to best navigate the domain. Each event should be discussed with all participants to be certain that the entire team understands the details of the event. Other things to discuss include whether or not the event is in the proper place on the timeline, if there are any additional events that may be related to the one being discussed, if any duplicate events should be combined, if any of the questions or risks identified in the pink stickies can be resolved, and if there are additional questions or concerns that should be called-out using pink stickies.</p>
<p>Finally, for each event, be certain that any important terms are documented in the Ubiquitous Language document and that we are not using synonyms of the documented terms to describe our events. We always want to use the correct terminology to describe all aspects of our domain.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/EventStorming-RefineDomainEvents.png" alt="After Step 2 - Refine Domain Events" /></p>
<h3>3 - Track Causes</h3>
<p>In step 3, things start to get really interesting. The goal of this step is to determine the causes of each of the Domain Events. There are three causes of domain events: User actions, Business Processes, and External Systems. For each event we need to identify the interactions surrounding it, including what triggers it, and what downstream events it may cause. This step, once completed, results in a model that looks like a series of flows.</p>
<h4>User Actions</h4>
<p>Users typically trigger events via View Models and Commands. A view model may be displayed to the user from which they issue a command to take an action. This command may directly result in a Domain Event, but is more likely to be consumed by a Business Process which may validate the command before either rejecting it or executing logic that results in a Domain Event.</p>
<h4>Business Processes</h4>
<p>Business Processes often produce one or more events during the execution of their logic. An example might be that when a question is answered by a user in a StackOverflow type Q &amp; A domain, it results in a “Question Answered” event. This event may be consumed by a business process to notify subscribed users resulting in one or more “User Notified” events. Business Processes often make use of Read Models to provide additional information as to the state of the system.</p>
<h4>External Systems</h4>
<p>External Systems are business processes that exist outside of the domain, and as such, have a smaller surface with which to interact with our systems. These processes may utilize Read Models from within our domain to gather information and are usually modeled as creating Domain Events to interact with the system. These interactions are typically modeled as Domain Events because most external system events are seen as important historical facts to our business. After all, if they weren’t important to our business domain experts, why would our systems care about them at all? This is not a hard and fast rule however and your domain may differ. It is conceivable that external logic could issue Commands to internal systems, though it seems more reasonable that those would be viewed as Domain Events.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/EventStorming-TrackCauses.png" alt="After Step 3 - Track Causes" /></p>
<h3>4 - Aggregation (Software Modeling)</h3>
<p>The final step is all about grouping our new logic flows around the Aggregates they act upon and describing the communications between these newly identified sub-domains.</p>
<p>As you recall, an Aggregate is an object graph treated as a single object and identified by the Aggregate Root. In this step we identify the aggregates in our system, and then group each of the flows from step 3 by the Aggregate they act upon. At the same time, we can draw lines between the groups to identify the communications across these boundaries. This will result in the final model of this process, a set of flows grouped by their Aggregate into subdomains that can often be viewed as a good proxy for a microservice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The practice of Event Storming offers a dynamic and inclusive approach to understanding and modeling business domains, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders. By fostering collaboration, promoting a shared language, and visualizing the flow of Domain Events, teams can unlock a deeper comprehension of the business processes at hand. This method not only streamlines the development process but also ensures that the resulting software systems are precisely aligned with business objectives. As we've seen, Event Storming stands out as an invaluable tool in the arsenal of modern software development practices, embodying principles of agility, domain-driven design, and team cohesion to tackle complex domain problems effectively.</p>

    <p>Have you ever experienced that feeling you get when you need to extend an existing system and there is an extension point that is exactly what you need to build on?</p>
<p>For example, suppose I get a request to extend a system so that an additional action is taken whenever a new user signs-up.  The system already has an event message that is published whenever a new user signs-up that contains all of the information I need for the new functionality.  All I have to do is subscribe a new microservice to this event message, and have that service take the new action whenever it receives a message. Boom! Done.</p>
<p>Now think about the converse. The many situations we’ve all experienced where there is no extension point. Or maybe there is an extension mechanism in place but it isn’t quite right; perhaps an event that doesn’t fire on exactly the situation you need, or doesn’t contain the data you require for your use case and you have to build an entirely new data support mechanism to get access to the bits you need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost to “go live” is only a small percentage of the lifetime total cost of ownership. – Andy Kyte for Gartner Research, 30 March 2010</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some conflicting principles at work here, but for me, these situations expose the critical importance of flexibility and extensibility in our application architectures.  After all, maintenance and extension are the two greatest costs in a typical application’s life-cycle. I don’t want to build things that I don’t yet need because the likelihood is that I will never need them (see <a href="..//Search/yagni.html">YAGNI</a>). However, I don’t want to preclude myself from building things in the future by making decisions that cripple flexibility. I certainly don’t want to have to do a full system redesign ever time I get a new requirement.</p>
<p>For me, this leads to a principle that I like to follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I value <strong>Flexibility</strong> over <strong>Optimization</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with the principles described in the Agile Manifesto that this is modeled after, this does not eliminate the item on the right in favor of the item on the left, it merely states that the item on the left is valued more highly.  This makes a ton of sense to me in this case because it is much easier to scale an application by adding instances, especially in these heady days of cloud computing, than it is to modify and extend it. I cannot add a feature by adding another instance of a service, but I can certainly overcome a minor or even moderate inefficiency by doing so. Of course, there is a cost to that as well, but typically that cost is far lower, especially in the short term, than the cost of maintenance and extension.</p>
<p>So, how does this manifest (see what I did there?) in practical terms?</p>
<p>For me, it means that I allow seams in my applications that I may not have a functional use for just yet. I may not build anything on those seams, but they exist and are available for use as needed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separating the tiers of my applications for loose-coupling using the Strategy and Repository patterns</li>
<li>Publishing events in event-driven systems whenever it makes sense, regardless of the number of subscriptions to that event when it is created</li>
<li>Including all significant data in event messages rather than just keys</li>
</ul>
<p>There are, of course, dangers here as well. It can be easy to fire events whenever we would generally issue a logging message.  Events should be limited to those in the problem domain (Domain Events), not application events. We can also reach a level of absurdity with the weight of each message. As with all things, a balance needs to be struck. In determining that balance, I value Flexibility over Optimization whenever it is reasonable and possible to do so.</p>

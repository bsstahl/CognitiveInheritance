    <p>Using a distributed cache such as Redis is a proven method of improving the performance and reliability of our applications. As with any tool, use in accordance with best practices will help to reduce support time and outages, and give our customers the best possible experience.</p>
<p>As much as we’d like to believe that our cloud services are highly available and reliable, the fact is that no matter how much effort goes into their resilience, we will never get 100% availability from them. Even if it is just due to random Internet routing issues, we must take measures to protect our applications, our customers, and our support personnel, from these inevitable hiccups. There are a number of patterns we can use to make our cache access more resilient, and therefore less susceptible to these outages. There are also libraries we can use to implement these patterns, allowing us to declare policies for these patterns, and implement and compose them with ease.</p>
<p>These concepts are useful in all tool chains, with or without a policy library, and policy libraries are available for many common development languages. However, this article will focus on using the <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/">Polly</a> library in <strong>C#</strong> for implementation. That said, I will attempt to describe the concepts, as much as possible, in terms that are accessible to developers using all tool chains. I have also used the Polly library generically. That is, any calls that result in data being returned could be used in place of the caching operations described here. In addition, for clients that use Microsoft’s <strong>IDisributedCache</strong> abstraction, there is a caching specific package, <strong>Polly.Caching.Distributed</strong>, that does all of these same things, but with a simplified syntax for caching operations.</p>
<h3>Basic Cache-Retrieval</h3>
<p>The most straightforward use-case for a caching client is to have the cache pre-populated by some other means so that the client only has to retrieve required values. In this situation, either the value is successfully retrieved from the cache, or some error condition occurs (perhaps a null returned or an Exception thrown). This usage, as described, is very simple, but can still provide a lot of value for our applications. Having low-latency access to data across multiple instances of our application can certainly improve the performance of our apps, but can also improve their reliability, depending on the original data source. We can even use the cache as a means for our services to own-their-own-data, assuming we take any long-term persistence needs into account.</p>
<p>It goes without saying however that this simple implementation doesn’t handle every circumstance on its own. Many situations exist where the data cannot all be stored in the cache. Even if the cache can be fully populated, there are circumstances, depending on the configuration, where values may need to be evicted. This pattern also requires each client to handle cache errors and misses on their own, and provides no short-circuiting of the cache during outage periods. In many cases, these types of situations are handled, often very differently, by the consuming clients. Fortunately, tools exist for many languages that allow us to avoid repeating the code to manage these situations by defining policies to handle them.</p>
<h3>Using a Circuit-Breaker Policy</h3>
<p>It is an unfortunate fact of distributed system development that our dependencies will be unavailable at times. Regardless of how reliable our networks and cloud dependencies are, we have to act like they will be unavailable, because sometimes they will be. One of the ways we have to protect our applications from these kinds of failures is to use a circuit-breaker.</p>
<p>A circuit-breaker allows us to specify conditions where the cache is not accessed by our client, but instead the cache-call fails immediately. This may seem counterintuitive, but in circumstances where we are likely in the middle of an outage, skipping the call to the cache allows us to fail quickly. This quick-failure protects the users from long timeout waits, and reduces the number of network calls in-process. Keeping the number of network calls low reduces the risk of having our pods recycled due to port-exhaustion problems, and allows our systems to recover from these outages gracefully.</p>
<p>To use a Polly circuit-breaker in C#, we first define the policy, then execute our request against the policy. For example, a sample policy to open the circuit-breaker under the configured conditions and log the change of state is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Circuit Breaker Policy.png" alt="Circuit Breaker Policy" /></p>
<p>This code uses the static logger to log the state changes and has members (<strong>_circuitBreakerFailureThresholdPercentage</strong>, <strong>_circuitBreakerSamplingDuration</strong>, etc...) for the configuration values that specify the failure conditions. For example, we could configure this policy to open when 50% of our requests fail during a 15 second interval where we handle at least 20 requests. We could then specify to keep the circuit open for 1 minute before allowing traffic through again. A failure, in this policy, is defined at the top of the above expression as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When any Exception occurs (<em>.Handle<Exception>()</em>) or</li>
<li>When a default result is returned such as a null (<em>.OrResult(default(T))</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once our policy is available, we can simply execute our cache requests in the context of that policy. So, if we call our cache on a dependency held in a _cacheClient member, it might look like the samples below with and without using a policy.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Cache Retrieval with and without Policy.png" alt="Cache Retrieval with and without Policy" /></p>
<p>To use the policy, we call the same method as we would call without the policy, but do so within the ExecuteAsync method of the policy object. You might notice there is a Context object passed in to the policy. This allows information to be passed-around to the different sections of the policy. We will be using this later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...the lambda that is executed when the circuit is opened is also a good place to execute logic to help the system to recover. This might include resetting the multiplexer if you are using the <strong>StackExchange.Redis</strong> client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Executing our cache requests within the context of this policy allows the policy to keep track of the results of our requests and trigger the policy if the specified conditions are met. When this policy is triggered, the state of the circuit is automatically set to open and no requests are allowed to be serviced until the circuit is closed again. When either of these state transitions occur (Closed=&gt;Open or Open=&gt;Closed) the appropriate lambda is executed in the policy. Only logging is being done in this example, but the lambda that is executed when the circuit is opened is also a good place to execute logic to help the system to recover. This might include resetting the multiplexer if you are using the <strong>StackExchange.Redis</strong> client.</p>
<p>We can now protect our applications against outages. However, this does nothing to handle the situation where the data is not available in our cache. For this, we need a Failover (Fallback) policy.</p>
<h3>Using a Failover Policy to Fall-Back to the System of Record</h3>
<p>Many use-cases for caching involve holding frequently or recently retrieved values in the cache to avoid round-trips to a relational or other data source. This pattern speeds access to these data items while still allowing the system to gather and cache the information if it isn’t already in the cache.</p>
<p>Many policy libraries have methods to handle this pattern as well. A Polly policy describing this pattern is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Failover Policy.png" alt="Failover Policy" /></p>
<p>And to access the cache using this policy, we might use code like this.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Cache Retrieval with Failover.png" alt="Cache Retrieval with Failover" /></p>
<p>You’ll notice that the code to update the cache is specified in the policy itself (the 2nd Lambda). Like the circuit-breaker, this policy  responds when any Exception is thrown or a default value (i.e. null) is returned. Unlike the circuit-breaker however, this policy executes its code every time there is a miss or error, not just when thresholds have been exceeded.  You’ll also notice that, in the calling code, a <strong>Context</strong> object is defined and the cache key value is added to that property bag. This is used in the handling mechanism to access the value from the System of Record and to update the cache with that value. Once the value has been updated in the cache, it is returned to the caller by being pulled back out of the property bag by the 1st Lambda expression in the policy.</p>
<p>We’ll need to be careful here that we set the <strong>_failoverCacheEntryOptions</strong> appropriately for our use-case. If we allow our values to live too long in the cache without expiring, we can miss changes, or cause other values to be ejected from the cache. As always, be thoughtful with how long to cache the values in your use-case. We also do nothing here to handle errors occurring in the fallback system. You’ll want to manage those failures appropriately as well.</p>
<p>We can now declare a policy to fail-over to the system of record if that is appropriate for our use-case, but this policy doesn’t do anything to protect our systems from outages like our circuit-breaker example does. This is where our policy libraries can really shine, in their ability to combine policies.</p>
<h3>Wrapping It Up - Combining Multiple Policies using Policy Wrappers</h3>
<p>One of the real advantages of using a policy library like Polly is the ability to chain policies together to form complex reliability logic. Before going too deep into how we can use this to protect our cache-based applications, let’s look at the code to combine the two policies defined above, the Circuit-Breaker and Fallback policies. The code inside the <strong>CreateFallbackPolicy</strong> and <strong>CreateCircuitBreakerPolicy</strong> methods are just the return statements shown above that create each policy.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Wrapped Policy.png" alt="Wrapped Policy" /></p>
<p>These policies are executed in the order specified, which means that the last one specified is the one closest to the cache itself. This is important because, if our circuit is open, we want the Fallback policy to handle the request and fail-over to the system of record. If we were to reverse this order, opening the circuit would mean that the Fallback policy is never executed because the Circuit Breaker policy would block it.</p>
<p>This combined policy, as shown above, does everything we need from a cache client for our most common use-cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Returns the value from the cache on cache-hit</li>
<li>Returns the value from the backup system (system of record) on cache-miss</li>
<li>Populates the cache with values retrieved from the backup system on cache-miss</li>
<li>Opens the circuit for the specified time if our failure thresholds are reached, indicating an outage</li>
<li>Gives us the opportunity to perform other recovery logic, such as resetting the Multiplexer, when the circuit is opened</li>
<li>Closes the circuit again after the specified timeframe</li>
<li>Gives us the opportunity to to perform other logic as needed when the circuit is closed</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases our applications have implemented some or all of this logic themselves, whether it is in custom clients or abstractions like Queries or Repositories. If these applications are working well, and adequately protecting our systems and our customers from the inevitable failures experienced by distributed systems, there is certainly no need to change them. However, for systems that are experiencing problems when outages occur, or those being built today, I highly recommend considering using a policy library such as Polly to implement these reliability measures.</p>

    <p>Have you ever experienced that feeling you get when you need to extend an existing system and there is an extension point that is exactly what you need to build on?</p>
<p>For example, suppose I get a request to extend a system so that an additional action is taken whenever a new user signs-up.  The system already has an event message that is published whenever a new user signs-up that contains all of the information I need for the new functionality.  All I have to do is subscribe a new microservice to this event message, and have that service take the new action whenever it receives a message. Boom! Done.</p>
<p>Now think about the converse. The many situations we’ve all experienced where there is no extension point. Or maybe there is an extension mechanism in place but it isn’t quite right; perhaps an event that doesn’t fire on exactly the situation you need, or doesn’t contain the data you require for your use case and you have to build an entirely new data support mechanism to get access to the bits you need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost to “go live” is only a small percentage of the lifetime total cost of ownership. – Andy Kyte for Gartner Research, 30 March 2010</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some conflicting principles at work here, but for me, these situations expose the critical importance of flexibility and extensibility in our application architectures.  After all, maintenance and extension are the two greatest costs in a typical application’s life-cycle. I don’t want to build things that I don’t yet need because the likelihood is that I will never need them (see <a href="..//Search/yagni.html">YAGNI</a>). However, I don’t want to preclude myself from building things in the future by making decisions that cripple flexibility. I certainly don’t want to have to do a full system redesign ever time I get a new requirement.</p>
<p>For me, this leads to a principle that I like to follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I value <strong>Flexibility</strong> over <strong>Optimization</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with the principles described in the Agile Manifesto that this is modeled after, this does not eliminate the item on the right in favor of the item on the left, it merely states that the item on the left is valued more highly.  This makes a ton of sense to me in this case because it is much easier to scale an application by adding instances, especially in these heady days of cloud computing, than it is to modify and extend it. I cannot add a feature by adding another instance of a service, but I can certainly overcome a minor or even moderate inefficiency by doing so. Of course, there is a cost to that as well, but typically that cost is far lower, especially in the short term, than the cost of maintenance and extension.</p>
<p>So, how does this manifest (see what I did there?) in practical terms?</p>
<p>For me, it means that I allow seams in my applications that I may not have a functional use for just yet. I may not build anything on those seams, but they exist and are available for use as needed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separating the tiers of my applications for loose-coupling using the Strategy and Repository patterns</li>
<li>Publishing events in event-driven systems whenever it makes sense, regardless of the number of subscriptions to that event when it is created</li>
<li>Including all significant data in event messages rather than just keys</li>
</ul>
<p>There are, of course, dangers here as well. It can be easy to fire events whenever we would generally issue a logging message.  Events should be limited to those in the problem domain (Domain Events), not application events. We can also reach a level of absurdity with the weight of each message. As with all things, a balance needs to be struck. In determining that balance, I value Flexibility over Optimization whenever it is reasonable and possible to do so.</p>

    <p>I've written and spoken before about the importance of using the Strategy Pattern to create maintainable and testable systems. Strategies are even more important, almost to the level of necessity, when building AI systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Strategy Pattern is to algorithms what the Repository Pattern is to data stores, a useful and well-known abstraction for loose-coupling.
— Barry Stahl (@bsstahl) <a href="https://twitter.com/bsstahl/status/817398427529003008">January 6, 2017</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Strategy Pattern is an abstraction tool used to maintain loose-coupling between an application and the algorithm(s) that it uses to do its job. Since the algorithms used in AI systems have many different ways they could be implemented, it is important to abstract the implementation from the system that uses it. I tend to work with systems that use combinatorial optimization methods to solve their problems, but there are many ways for AIs to make decisions. Machine Learning is one of the hottest methods right now but AI systems can also depend on tried-and-true object-oriented logic. The ability to swap algorithms without changing the underlying system allows us the flexibility to try multiple methods before settling on a specific implementation, or even to switch-out implementations as scenarios or situations change.</p>
<p>When I give <a href="../Pages/Speaking-Engagements.html">conference talks</a> on building AI Systems using optimization methods, I always encourage the attendees to create a &quot;naïve&quot; solution first, before spending a lot of effort to build complicated logic. This allows the developer to understand the problem better than he or she did before doing any implementation. Creating this initial solution has another advantage though, it allows us to define the Strategy interface, giving us a better picture of what our application truly needs. Then, when we set-out to build a production-worthy engine, we do so with the knowledge of exactly what we need to produce.</p>
<p>There is also another component of many AIs that can benefit from the use of the Strategy pattern, and that is the determination of user intent. Many implementations of AI will include a user interaction, perhaps through a text-based interface as in a chatbot or a voice interface such as a personal assistant. Each cloud provider has their own set of services designed to determine the intent of the user based on the text or voice input. Each of these implementations has its own strengths and weaknesses. It is beneficial to be able to swap those mechanisms out at will, along with the ability to implement a &quot;naïve&quot; user intent solution during development, and the ability to mock user intent for testing. The strategy pattern is the right tool for this job as well.</p>
<p>As more and more of our applications depend heavily on algorithms, we will need to make a concerted effort to abstract those algorithms away from our applications to maintain loose-coupling and all of the benefits that loose-coupling provides. This is why I consider the Strategy Pattern to be a necessity when developing Artificial Intelligence solutions.</p>

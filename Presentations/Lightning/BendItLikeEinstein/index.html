<aside class="notes"><p>Time Dilation blew everyone's mind starting in 1905 with the publication of Einstein's theory of Special Relativity in which he posited that, as we move faster and faster, getting closer to the speed of light, time slows down relative to a stationary observer.  Thus, it was slightly less startling in 1916 when Einstein generalized the concept to include proximity to a strong source of gravity.  I don't, as yet, have the ability to travel at relativistic speeds, but, fortunately or otherwise, I do have some experience with gravity, so that is where we'll focus this discussion.</p>

This is where we got our idea of the left brain being the engineering and and critical thinking center and the right brain being the creativity center of the of the brain.  Theories in this space have gotten a lot more nuanced since then, at least partially as a result of improvements to neuroimaging.  We've gotten a lot better at being able to see what parts of the brain light up when we do different things, and this has led to a few additional theories.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>These 2 theories have led to some very interesting experiments. One such experiment was done by David Eagleman and his team.  Eagleman had a theory that people can do more work during a situation of hightened stress.  So he designed an experiment where he pushed people off high towers into safety nets and measured how much they could accomplish.  The thinking was that if we could use this stress to move the brain into &quot;System 1&quot; mode (fast thinking), we could accomplish more.  Fortunately for us, the data did not support that theory.  Even though participants all reported the time spent in free-fall as much longer than it actually was, their ability to process information didn't improve.  This suggested to him that time slowing was actually a retrospective view.  Eagleman theorized that, in our brains, the amygdala kicked in and wrote more memories of this time, due to the stress, and therefore, when we look back at it, it feels like it took longer than it did.  So now, the thinking is that high stress situations lead to increased memory encoding, and thus the feeling of things taking longer than they actually did.

<aside class="notes"><p>So, while we may not fully understand why just yet, it is clear that our time perception is skewed by being in high gravity situations.  If we have focused attention, if we're under high stress, if we're worried about something, it takes up more of our thoughts, and therefore we write more memories of it, and it feels like it took longer than it did.  We have dilated time by making the experience of these unimportant tasks. These focused attention tasks, seem longer than they actually took.  Likewise, the autonomous things, the things we're doing when we're having fun or when we're in flow state, are the things that feel like they don't take any time at all, because we're not in a high gravity situation.</p>

It seems as though we dedicate every waking moment to our mundane responsibilities, mainly because we worry about these tasks, so they tend to monopolize our memory.  This perceived disproportion of time spent results in a feeling of underachievement, pressuring us to pour even more time into these tasks.  This cycle squeezes out the time for activities we truly relish, creating a frustrating paradox of productivity.  I remember flying through the air as if it was in slow motion - I don't remember flow-state at all.  Time didn't exist during flow.  It just didn't even happen.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Since the problem then is that our minds are making mundane things, these things that are not important to us, more memorable than the things we really care about, what can we do about it? I like to call this process focus modulation, which is really just 2 things, but there are lots of different ways to do these 2 particular things. Step one is to make sure that we cultivate and document our productive time. Create the conditions for a flow state and then recognize it after it happened and narrate it, bringing it to the forefront of our attention.  I believe the most important thing we can do with our work is to narrate it, either to ourselves or to someone else. Microblog it, journal it, blog about it if that's what you prefer, just make sure you've registered the fact in your mind that you did this thing. It doesn't have to be public, just make sure you recognize that you spent this time doing this thing that you value. Likewise try not to focus on less productive things.  It's hard, but try not to worry so much about the unimportant stuff.</p>
<p>I'd like to leave you with one more thought.  I highly recommend you do these things, find ways that work for you to to perform, focus modulation and put more of your attention spotlight on the things that are really important to you.

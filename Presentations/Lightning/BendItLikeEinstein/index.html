<aside class="notes"><p>Neuroscientist David Eagleman has done some fascinating research about how we experience time. Some of this research involved flinging volunteers off of high towers and measuring if people accomplish more during free-fall then they can normally. It turns out falling off a tower is only the second most effective way to slow down time, the first, of course, is  attending meetings! I mean, who needs high towers when you've got a two-hour status meeting?</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>As a Software Engineer I usually do the opposite. That is, I regularly make time fly. I mean, just give me a deadline and I'll watch it fly by. But really, when I'm building software I experience time very differently. Since I am focused on solving the problem, and not on experiencing the situation, my perception of time is skewed and it seems like the event happened faster than it did. This is why software engineers are notoriously bad at estimating the time their tasks take to complete. At least, that's the story I'm sticking with.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>I've had three instances thusfar where I have personally bent time. The first was in the late '80s, at a Guns n' Roses concert in Phoenix, where I experienced this temporal wizardry. As the drummer Steven Adler concluded his solo, he lobbed a drumstick into the crowd. Sensing an opportunity, I used a bench seat as a springboard to propel myself skywards as he launched his second stick high over my head.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>As if in a slow-motion action movie, I soared, my hand securely snagging the spinning drumstick mid-air. The memory of my descent is lost to me, replaced by the sensation of being caught by numerous, unknown arms in the crowd. To those anonymous saviours, if you're here today, heartfelt thanks! Also, a solemn promise: I'll not to make a habit of launching myself at you.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>The 2nd time I experienced this curiosity was surprisingly similar to the 1st. There was a time in my life when I was considered an athlete (no need to laugh at that). My favorite sport was baseball. Back then, the coaches would time me running around the bases with a stopwatch. Today, they'd be more likely to use a calendar.</p>
<p>I played many years of baseball but it wasn't until I was playing in a beer league softball game with my father that I felt like I had actually stopped time again.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>It was the final inning and we were up by 1 run. I was playing 3rd base when the other team's slugger smashed a line-drive to my right. The whole event must have happened in less than a second, but as I remember it, I had time to think about what I was going to do to catch that ball. Like at the concert, I have very clear, slow-motion memories of diving to my right and watching my glove close on the ball for the out. This time, I also remember the landing on the dusty Arizona base path.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the thing I remember most about the celebration was my father, and my best friend admitting they missed the play. They told me I had to go do it again. Stopping time is one thing, rolling it back is something else entirely.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>The last time I can recall experiencing this phenomenon was perhaps the most interesting in that it involved a dangerous situation, being thrown from a horse. Like the other events, I have vivid memories of the horse sending me flying through the air, having plenty of time to think about how I should relax, and then roll when I hit the ground, all while trying to avoid any steaming piles lying about. The only thing that ended up being hurt in that fall was my pride.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Unfortunately, it turns out that Dr. Eagleman's research suggests we don't actually accomplish more under these kinds of high-gravity situations. His theory is that our amygdala kicks-in, bringing all of the brain's available resources to bear and ultimately writing more memories of these events. This means we end up remembering it as if it took longer than it actually did. Basically, the brain dedicates all resources to the matter that aren't being used for nice-to-haves like keeping us breathing. In other words, it becomes one of our brain's &quot;big rock projects&quot;.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>The key to understanding time-dilation then might be found in our attention spotlight. It seems as though we dedicate every waking moment to our primary responsibilities, mainly because these tasks tend to monopolize our memory due to our constant worry over them. This perceived disproportion of time spent results in a feeling of underachievement, pressuring us to pour even more time into these tasks. This cycle squeezes out the time for activities we truly relish, creating a frustrating paradox of productivity.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>That means, if instead of spending all of our energy focusing on making that leaping grab of a feature or diving catch of a bug-fix, we focus on being present in the moment for the things that make time seem to fly for us, we'll be bending our concept of time. If we don't, we'll either have to be put in a slower group or allow our managers to push us off high towers.</p>
